<p class="drop-cap">“WILLIAM FOX? He’s the most
brilliant man they’ve got, but a
two-edged sword; they’re all
afraid of him!”</p>

<p>The speaker had just left the swinging doors
at the foot of the staircase from the Rotunda,
under the old Library rooms in the west front
of the Capitol, and his companion, who was also
a member, was working himself slowly into his
greatcoat.</p>

<p>“No wonder; he’s got a tongue like a whiplash
and his smooth ways only make its sting
worse,” he retorted, between his struggles with a
recalcitrant sleeve lining and a stiff shoulder.</p>

<p>“That’s it, his tongue and his infernal sarcastic
humor,” Fox’s admirer admitted with reluctance,
“but his logic—it’s magnificent,—his
mind cuts as clean as a diamond; look at his
speech on the Nicaraguan affair. Lord, I’d like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
to see the opposition beat it! They can’t do it;
they’ve done nothing but snarl since. He’ll be
President some day—if he doesn’t cut his own
throat.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, man!” retorted the other irritably,
“he’s brilliant, but as unstable as water, and a
damned egoist!”</p>

<p>They had reached the top of the wide steps
which descend from the west terrace, and Allestree
lost the reply to his outburst in the increasing
distance as they went down into the park below.
He stood looking after their indistinctly outlined
figures as they disappeared slowly into the soft
mist which enveloped the scene at his feet. It was
about six o’clock, an early December evening, and
already night overhead where the sky was heavily
clouded. The streets, streaming with water,
showed broad circles of shimmering light under
the electric lamps, and the naked trees and the
ilexes clustered below the terrace made a darkness
through which, and beyond, he saw the long, converging
vista of the Avenue, lined on either side
with what seemed to be wavering and brilliant
rainbows, suspended above the wet pavements and
apparently melting into one in the extreme distance,
as though he looked into the sharp apex
of a triangle. The whole was veiled and mystically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
obscured by a palely luminous vapor which
transformed and softened every object, while the
vehicles and pedestrians, constantly hurrying
across the foreground, loomed exaggerated and
fantastic in the fog. Now and then a keen point
of light, the eye of some motor-car, approached,
flashed past the Peace Monument and was lost at
the elbow of the Hill.</p>

<p>The terrace, except for Allestree, was deserted,
and the continuous murmur and roar of city life
came up to him slightly softened and subdued,
both by the atmospheric depression and the intervening
space of the park. Behind him both wings
of the Capitol were vividly lighted, for the House
had just risen after a heated debate, prolonged,
as he amusedly surmised, by the eloquence of
William Fox.</p>

<p>At the thought, that much discussed figure
arose before his mind’s eye in a new aspect created
by the fragment of conversation which had just
reached him. He was in the habit of viewing Fox
from that intimate standpoint which, discovering
all the details, loses the larger effect of the whole;
as the man in the wings of the theatre, disillusioned
by the tinsel on the costume of an actor
and the rouge on his face, loses the grand climax
of his dramatic genius and sees instead only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
charlatan. Yet Allestree’s affection for his cousin
was strong enough to embrace even those defects,
of which he was keenly aware, and personal
enough to feel a thrill of elation at the constant
evidences of an increasing recognition of Fox’s
really great abilities. Yet there was something
amusing in the fear which he was beginning to
inspire in his opponents; amusing, at least, to
one who knew him, as Allestree did, to be a man
of careless good humor and large indifference.</p>

<p>Knowing all Fox’s peculiarities, his not infrequent
relaxations, and the complex influences
which were at work upon his temperament—the
irresponsible temperament of genius—Allestree
could not but speculate a little upon that future
which was beginning to be of poignant interest
to more than one aspirant in the great arena of
public life.</p>

<p>But his reflections were cut short at this point
by the abrupt appearance of Fox himself. He
came out of the same door which had, a few moments
earlier, emitted his critics, and as he
emerged upon the terrace the keen light from the
electric globes at the head of the steps fell full
on his remarkable face and figure. For, while by
no means above the average in stature, Fox possessed
one of those personalities which cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
overlooked. Genius like beauty has magnetic
qualities of its own and, even at night and out of
doors, Allestree was fully aware of the singular
brilliance and penetration of his glance.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob,” he said genially, as he joined his
cousin, “you’re a lucky dog, out here in the open!
The House has steamed like the witches’ cauldron
to-night and brewed devil’s broth, tariff revision
and all manner of damnable heresies.”</p>

<p>Allestree smiled grimly in the dusk. “Then
you must be the father of them,” he retorted;
“I just heard that you’d been making a speech.”</p>

<p>“Eh? you did, did you?” Fox paused an instant
to light his cigar; “so I did,” he admitted,
tossing away the match, “I talked tommyrot for
an hour and a half to keep the House sitting; I
might be going on still if old Killigrew hadn’t
got to his feet and howled for adjournment. He
usually dines at six sharp, and it’s a quarter to
seven now; he had death and starvation in his
eye, and I yielded the point as a matter of humanity.”</p>

<p>“According to recent information you have
very little humanity in you,” Allestree replied, as
they descended the long flight of steps from the
terrace, “in fact, you are a ‘damned egoist.’”</p>

<p>Fox threw back his head with a hearty, careless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
laugh. “Which of my enemies have you been
interviewing?” he asked, with unruffled good
humor.</p>

<p>His cousin briefly related the result of his accidental
début in the rôle of eavesdropper, incidentally
describing the two men.</p>

<p>“I know who they are,” Fox said amusedly;
“one is Burns of Pennsylvania, and the other a
fellow from Rhode Island who is picking flaws in
everything and everybody; the government’s
rotten, the Senate’s corrupt, the Supreme Court
is senile—so on and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>! Meanwhile
there’s some kind of a scandal attached to
his own election—no one cares what! He reminds
me of Voltaire’s enraged description of
Jean Jacques with the rotten hoops off Diogenes’
tub.”</p>

<p>“That is not all; even your admirer feared
the suicidal effects of your tongue,” continued
Allestree teasingly, “which is said to be two-edged,
while your sarcasm is ‘infernal.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a mere <i>façon de parler</i>,” laughed
Fox, “I’m really as mild as a lamb and as harmless
as a dove!”</p>

<p>“Quite so!” retorted his cousin dryly, “yet
I think most of your enemies and some of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
friends resort to the litany when you cut loose
for an oratorical flight.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s said that even the devil goes to
prayers on occasions,” said Fox with a shrug,
“so why not my enemies? By the way, the nominations
were sent to the Senate just before adjournment
to-night, and the Cabinet changes are
slated; I heard it as I came out.”</p>

<p>“Does Wingfield go out?” Allestree asked,
after a momentary pause, as they threaded their
way between the electric cars and the carriages
which were slightly congested at the crossing
below the Peace Monument.</p>

<p>Fox nodded. “And Seymour gets his place,
while Wicklow White is made Secretary of the
Navy.”</p>

<p>His companion looked up quickly and caught
only his pale profile outlined against the surrounding
fog; his expression was enigmatical.
“Upon my word!” exclaimed Allestree, “White’s
luck is stupendous—you remember what a block-head
we always thought him at Harvard? Well,
well, Margaret will have her heart’s desire,” he
added amusedly.</p>

<p>Fox slightly frowned. “So!” he said contemptuously,
“you think the sum total of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
woman’s desire is to see a chump of a husband
with his foot in the stirrup?”</p>

<p>His cousin smiled coldly. “My dear fellow, it
was for that Margaret married him,” he retorted,
“that and his money. When I see her, as I saw
her the other night, the most beautiful and charming
creature, in a miracle of a costume,—she
knows how to wear clothes that make pictures,—I
longed to say to her:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘You that have so fair parts of woman on you,</div>
<div class="verse">Have too a woman’s heart: which ever yet</div>
<div class="verse">Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Pshaw, you dreamer of dreams and painter
of pictures; it’s a hollow show, an ugly travesty!
What has a man like White to give such a woman?
The husks of the prodigal!” Fox’s luminous
dark eyes kindled with anger, “when I see
him—” he checked himself abruptly and walked
on rapidly, his long, easy stride carrying him
ahead of Allestree. “Pearls before swine!” he
muttered to himself after a moment, plunging his
hands into his pockets and relapsing into an
angry silence.</p>

<p>They walked on at a smart pace, having occasionally
to thread their way single file through the
increasing throng, as the long blocks slipped behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
them and they approached the heart of business
life near Fourteenth Street. When they
came together again after such a separation,
Allestree asked Fox if he could come home with
him to dine but Fox declined rather curtly, pleading
an early evening engagement, and Allestree
said no more, having his own surmises as to the
nature of that engagement, and being somewhat
guiltily aware that he was not an entirely involuntary
party to his mother’s conspiracy to draw
Fox away from a dangerous attraction. Both
men were, in fact, conscious that a discord had
arisen in their usually confidential relations, and
neither of them desired to broach any subject
which would add acrimony to the conversation;
with the usual masculine instinct of self-defense,
therefore, they relapsed into silence. However,
at the entrance of a large hotel on the corner,
their hurried progress was interrupted to give
way to a visitor who was crossing the wide pavement
to her carriage, escorted by one of the attendants
and a footman. The light from the
lobby, brilliantly illuminating the space beneath
the awning, outlined her as sharply as a silhouette
against the darkness, and her figure,—she was
a young and slender girl,—was thrown into
high relief; the quiet elegance of her dress, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
sables on her shoulders, as well as the large picture
hat which framed her face, being merely
superfluous accessories to beauty of a type at
once unusual and spiritual.</p>

<p>Fox, startled out of a revery which was largely
pervaded by the personality of another woman,
could not but observe this radiant picture; there
was a vitality, a power of expression in every
feature of her face and every movement of her
tall, lithe figure which at once specialized her.
She seemed to belong to a different race of beings
from those who were hurrying past her through
the fog, whose figures lost themselves at once to
vision and memory, dissolving into the masses of
the commonplace, as completely as the individual
sands at the seashore are lost in the larger sweep
of the dunes.</p>

<p>She turned her head, saw Allestree and smiled.
“How are you?” she said, with the easy manner
of an old intimacy; “I hardly dare look at you—I
know I broke the appointment and several of
the studio commandments!”</p>

<p>Allestree had hurried forward at once, apparently
forgetting his companion, and was helping
her into her carriage. “You did,” he said, “and
shamelessly; but you must come and make
amends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>She laughed, her hand on the carriage door,
and her eyes, involuntarily passing him to Fox,
were as quickly averted. “I will, on Saturday
at twelve—will that do, Bobby? Don’t be too
exacting. I’ve a dozen engagements, you know,”
she added lightly, in a tone of careless propitiation.</p>

<p>Fox did not catch his cousin’s reply, it was too
low spoken, and in a moment the horses started
and the carriage passed him on its way to F
Street. Secretly a little piqued at Allestree’s
failure to present him, and yet amused at his discovery
of his cousin playing knight-errant to a
beauty, Fox walked on a few moments in silence,
aware that the other was not a little confused.</p>

<p>But at last: “Who is she, Bob, wood-nymph,
dryad, or Psyche herself?”</p>

<p>Allestree’s face sobered sharply. “It was Miss
Temple,” he said, a trifle stiffly.</p>

<p>Fox gave a moment to reflection. “Ah,” he
observed, “I recollect, Judge Temple has a
daughter. I had never seen her; I’ve heard her
spoken of, though, a hundred times; her name
is—?”</p>

<p>“Rose Temple.”</p>

<p>William Fox glanced at his companion obliquely
and smiled, but he made no attempt at pleasantry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
After a little, however, as they approached the
residential quarter and neared his club, where he
intended to dine, he returned to the subject.
“You are painting Miss Temple’s portrait?”</p>

<p>“Yes, attempting it,” assented Allestree, with
marked reluctance; he felt it to be almost a sacrilege
to speak of a piece of work which had become,
in more ways than one, a labor of love.</p>

<p>He was indeed painting Rose Temple’s portrait,
for he was already a notable portrait
painter, but he was doing it much as Raphael may
have painted the Sistine Madonna, with a reverence
which was full of ineffable tenderness and inspiration,
and he was too keenly aware of Fox’s
intimate knowledge of him and his unmerciful insight
into human motives to endure the thought of
Fox in possession of his inmost secrets and on
terms of friendship with Rose. Fox! one of the
most enigmatical, the most dangerous, the most
fascinating personalities—Allestree had seen the
potency of that spell—to be brought in contact
with any woman, and most of all with a young
and imaginative girl.</p>

<p>After a moment Fox’s laugh interrupted him.
“My dear Allestree,” he said provokingly, “why
not paint the Angel Gabriel?”</p>

<p>His companion, whose sensitiveness amounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
to an exquisite self-torture, bit his lip and made
no reply.</p>

<p>At the door of the club they both paused as
Allestree prepared to take a car uptown while his
cousin went in to dine.</p>

<p>“Sorry you can’t come to us,” he said, in a
tone which was a shade less cordial than usual;
“mother will be disappointed; there is no one
else coming, and she always counts greatly on a
talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Give her my love instead,” Fox retorted, with
easy kindness, “I’m sorry, but I dine here and
then go up to the Whites’. I promised; there’s
to be music—or something—to-night.”</p>

<p>Allestree slightly shrugged his shoulders. “So
I supposed,” he said dryly, and signalled his car.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A FEW hours later William Fox presented
himself at the home of the new Cabinet
minister. He was an intimate habitué of
the house; a fact which created no little comment
in social and political circles, for Fox and White
were naturally almost antipodal personalities and
had often engaged in political controversies,
which had inevitably ended in White’s defeat at
the hands of his daring and brilliant adversary.
But it was not their antipathies or their rivalries
in politics which aroused the gossip, of which Fox
was vaguely and carelessly aware, but the presupposed
existence of an old sentimental relation
between him and White’s wife. However, gossip
of all kinds troubled Fox but little, and he followed
his own inclinations with the indolent egoism
of a man who has been for many years the spoiled
darling of fortune.</p>

<p>The house was one of the old landmarks of
Washington, and the true values of space and
effect were consequently somewhat diminished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
low ceilings and small old-fashioned doors. As
Fox entered he heard the buzz of conversation in
the distance, in more tongues than English, and
when the butler announced him he came upon a
group of dinner guests who were gathered around
the immense fireplace at the end of the ballroom—a
huge addition to the original house especially
designed for the elaborate entertainments for
which the host and hostess were already famous—and
the warm glow of the leaping fire increased
the effect and brilliance of the scene.</p>

<p>At his name his hostess detached herself from
the group and tossing her cigarette into the fire
held out her hand in greeting. “You inconsequent
wretch!” she said, shaking an admonishing
finger, “late as usual—we expected you to
dinner and M. de Caillou tells us that, instead,
you made a great speech! Pray, what became of
you afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Total oblivion for the space of three hours,”
replied Fox gaily; “I come now to congratulate
you! The next step will be the Presidency,
White,” he added, as he shook hands with his host.</p>

<p>“If I can keep you out of it,” retorted the
secretary, dryly.</p>

<p>Fox laughed, acknowledging the intimate greetings
of the other guests. At a glance he saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the gathering was as notable as usual, and was
secretly amused at White’s attitude which seemed
to accept all this as his own achievement, ignoring
the influence of his wife. The French ambassador
was there, a Russian prince, an Austrian savant,
an Italian ex-diplomat, the chancellor of the
British embassy, two other Cabinet ministers, a
literary celebrity, a Roman Catholic dignitary,
and a somewhat notorious French journalist and
socialist who had dipped his pen in gall during
the controversy between France and the Vatican.
Margaret’s usual selections, Fox thought with a
smile, and noted that the only other woman was
Mrs. Osborne, the former wife of an American
ambassador to Russia, whose divorce had created
a sensation as distinct and startling as her beauty,
which was of that type which somewhat openly
advertises the additions of art. A woman, in fact,
who had given rise to so much “talk” that the
old-fashioned wondered at Margaret White’s complacence
in receiving her and even admitting her
upon terms of intimacy at the house. But Margaret’s
personality was as problematical as it was
charming. She stood now regarding Fox with a
slightly pensive expression in her gray eyes, which
seemed unusually large and bright because of the
dark shadows beneath them, while her small head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
was set on a slender white neck which supported
it like the stem of a flower. She was thin, but
with a daintiness which eliminated angles, and she
possessed in a marked degree, as Allestree had said,
the talent for artistic costumes; her slight figure,
which had the grace and delicate suppleness of
some fabled dryad, had the effect, at the moment,
of being marvellously enveloped in a clinging,
shimmering cloud of soft, gold-colored silk and
embroidery out of which her white shoulders rose
suddenly; she was much décolletée, and, except
for the jewelled shoulder-straps, her slender but
beautiful arms were bare.</p>

<p>She rested her hands on the high back of a
chair, apparently listening to all, but actually
attentive only to that which immediately concerned
Fox and her husband, who were exchanging
commonplaces with the purely perfunctory
manner of men who cordially detested each other
at heart.</p>

<p>“White only pretends indifference,” said Louis
Berkman, the literary genius, who was one of the
famous writers of the day; “actually he is overjoyed
at the exit of Wingfield; that is the very
pith of the matter, isn’t it, Mrs. White?”</p>

<p>Margaret shrugged her shoulders. “Why
not?” she retorted; “what was it Walpole said?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
‘One tiger is charmed if another tiger loses his
tail.’”</p>

<p>There was the general laugh at this, which always
followed Margaret’s careless and daring
candor.</p>

<p>“It was certainly a case of ‘heads or tails’
with the President,” Louis Berkman retorted, with
the ease of political detachment in the midst of
the inner circle of officialdom; “we shall have a
budget now which will carry a billion dollar naval
increase.”</p>

<p>“You’ve lived too long in England,” said Fox
amusedly, “you don’t get our terms, Berkman.
But we shall insist on Mrs. White christening all
the new ships.”</p>

<p>“To be sure—I forgot that I was speaking
to the money supply, Fox,” he replied; “heaven
help White if he gets into your clutches; I should
as soon expect mercy from an Iroquois Indian!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind that from you,” laughed Fox,—“we
expect anything from the ‘outs,’—as
long as you don’t write us up for the magazines!”</p>

<p>“The gods forbid!” said Berkman sharply,
“I’m not ‘the man with the muckrake;’ now
if—” he turned his head and, catching a glimpse
of the French journalist engaged in an animated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
discussion with the Italian ex-diplomat, who fairly
bristled with suppressed anger, he bit his lip to
hide a smile.</p>

<p>One of the secretaries leaned forward to select
a new cigarette from the elaborate gold box on the
table. “Berkman,” he remarked, “I read that
article of yours on the Duma with a great deal
of interest, but I got an impression that you lost
sight of the main issues in your passion for artistic
effects.”</p>

<p>The author responded at once to this challenge
with an eagerly indignant denial, and Fox found
himself again slightly detached from the group
and still standing beside his hostess. She had been
taking no part in the conversation and seemed to
be in a dreamy mood which ignored alike her environment
and her social duties. There was always
something in Margaret’s aspect which differentiated
her from other people, a spiritual
aloofness from the passing moment which could
fall upon her suddenly, even in her wildest and
gayest moods, and which always carried with it
a mystical, uninterpreted suggestion of some
tragic destiny, which cast a long shadow before
it across the unthinking sybaritism of her life.</p>

<p>“It seems some time since I saw you last,” said
Fox; “the House has been very exacting lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and abominably dull. What have you been doing
with yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, learning to dance,” she replied, “I’m to
be a Merry Andrew now, you know, for the delectation
of the dear public. Wicklow insists that
I must have public receptions; good heavens,
what an endless bore!”</p>

<p>Fox smiled. “He takes it seriously then, I
see! We must look higher, in that case; you may
as well study for the White House rôle at once.”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed derisively, glancing across
at her husband who was leaning over Mrs. Osborne’s
chair with a quite apparent air of absorption.
“Look at them!” she mocked, her eyes
gleaming with malicious mischief; “see the pose;
Lily Osborne is playing now for a Madame
d’Épinay; she discusses French literature and the
philosophers. Can you imagine Wicklow as Jean
Jacques? I must get him a black cloak!”</p>

<p>Fox laughed involuntarily, but said nothing;
Margaret’s free speech sometimes offended his
finer discrimination, and the notion of criticizing
White to White’s wife did not coincide with his
masculine code. “I heard that Mrs. Osborne won
the cup at the fencing contest,” he remarked, after
a moment.</p>

<p>“She did; Wicklow gave it, you know,” Margaret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
smiled sarcastically. Then she looked at
him suddenly. “Where did you dine to-night?—with
Allestree?”</p>

<p>“No, at the club. I really didn’t understand
that I was expected here.”</p>

<p>“I must have forgotten how to write notes, or
I have too much else to say to you. I’m going
to let Bobby Allestree paint my portrait; you
know he’s been trying to do it for years.”</p>

<p>Fox smiled. “I admire Allestree’s work,” he
said, “but there are limitations; one can’t paint
intangible sprites.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to infer that I’m not human?”
she retorted with a frown; “wait and see how
beautiful I shall be.”</p>

<p>“You don’t really want compliments from me,
Margaret?”</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, then she lifted her
softest glance to his face, her own pensive again
and slightly shadowed with thought. “No, I
don’t!” she said abruptly, “I don’t think I
should believe in them—it makes me shiver sometimes
to even imagine what you must think of
me!”</p>

<p>Fox hesitated how to reply; he was by no means
a prudent man, but he was instinctively aware of
the dangers of her mood, and he had swiftly entertained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and rejected two or three answers which
would have led them into yet deeper intricacies,
when they were happily interrupted by the approach
of the French ambassador, a gentleman
who united with great astuteness and diplomatic
suavity a strong resemblance to an intelligent and
bewhiskered French poodle.</p>

<p>“We have heard so much of those dancing
steps, Mrs. White; when shall we have the pleasure
of seeing them?” he asked, smilingly courteous
and attentive.</p>

<p>“Oh, now!—on the instant,” Margaret retorted,
her mood changing like a flash and her
eyes sparkling a gay defiance; “there’s no time
like the present. William, are the musicians
there?”</p>

<p>Fox looked across at the palm-screened alcove,
and catching a glimpse of a violin, assented. She
clapped her hands. “Tell them to play me the
Spanish piece which they played on Tuesday,”
she commanded.</p>

<p>At the first note there was a general cessation
of conversation, and every eye turned quickly
toward her. She stood in the centre of the room,
her slender arms raised and her hands clasped behind
her head, a dreamy expression on her half
lifted face, the shadowy masses of her pale brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
hair framing a white brow. Her eyes drooped,
her whole aspect seemed to change, like the
chameleon’s, to become an embodiment of the
dreamily seductive strains which floated softly into
space, then, as the music quickened and developed,
she began to sway slightly, dancing down the long
room alone, her clinging, shimmering skirts trailing
around her feet, flowing in and out, but never
seeming to arrest the wonderful rhythmic swing
of her movements. With her, dancing was an
interpretation of music, an expression of some
subtle mystery of her nature, the very personification
of an enchanting grace.</p>

<p>There was an almost breathless attention on the
part of her guests, and no one was conscious of
the displeasure on White’s full flushed face. No
one but his wife; as she danced to and fro, weaving
in the fantasy of strange figures, her eyes
rested occasionally on him, and the mockery of
her glance was a revelation to those who could
read it. It was but little observed, however, nor
was she understood when, at last, with a sudden
swift movement she caught up her filmy draperies,
displaying two slender ankles and a pair of wonderfully
shod feet, as she executed a deliberate
fandango which not a little amazed the more
sedate of her guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>In answer, perhaps, to some secret signal of
White’s, the music stopped abruptly and with it
Margaret’s astonishing performance. Quite unmoved,
and ignoring the interruption, or rather
treating it as the natural termination of her dance,
she turned with a graceful swirl of gleaming silks
and received the rather effusive applause of her
guests with heightened color and flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Louis Berkman alone had lost all the bizarre
effect of the finish, and been absorbed in the dance.
“A poem in motion, superb!” he exclaimed, with
such genuine enthusiasm that Margaret’s expression
softened.</p>

<p>The French ambassador was still softly applauding.
It appeared that he had seen Bernhardt
execute the same figures once; “but madame’s performance
was more exquisite, an interpretation,
the very expression of the music itself!”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” laughed Margaret maliciously,
“I’m an American, ambassador. Did you dream
that even Bernhardt could excel one?”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien!</i> I admire your patriotism, also,” he
replied smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only the screech of the eagle! Of
course you are all enthusiastic—all except you,
William,” she added abruptly, whirling around to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
confront Fox with a teasing glance, “you are
mute; didn’t I please you?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You bewildered me; the sudden
transitions are confusing. Where did you learn
the dance?”</p>

<p>She put her head on one side. “Last week—that’s
all I shall ever tell you!” she replied, “but
I want Bobby Allestree to paint my portrait dancing.
Wicklow would prize it so highly,” and she
laughed wickedly.</p>

<p>“Allestree is painting a portrait now, I think,”
Fox said, to turn her aside from a dangerous
channel, “Miss Temple’s, I believe.”</p>

<p>Margaret’s eyes widened and she looked keenly
at him, an indescribable change in her face.
“Rose—yes,” she said slowly, “have you seen
it?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “I saw her for the first
time to-night.”</p>

<p>She made no immediate reply. M. de Caillou
and Berkman had begun to talk together, and the
others were already engaged in animated conversation;
the controversy between the Italian and
the Frenchman having been resumed was rising in
a staccato duet. Fox was abruptly aware of a
stir in the room beyond and surmised the arrival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of evening guests, but his hostess was apparently
oblivious.</p>

<p>“She is supremely lovely at times,” she said
quietly, after a moment, “but—but not exactly
a beauty. What do you think of her?”</p>

<p>Fox parried the question easily. “My dear
Margaret, I only saw her for a moment getting
into her carriage.”</p>

<p>She gave him a searching glance and bit her
lip. He thought he had never seen her wear so
entirely the air of a spoiled child; her flushed
cheeks, her slightly rumpled hair and the angry
droop of her eyes, all appealed for praise and resented
criticism. “Allestree is painting her on
his knees,” she said, with a little bitter laugh; “he
doesn’t regard her as human; you will see that he
will make me the imp to her angel, he—”</p>

<p>“Margaret!” Mr. White was hurrying forward,
with the ruffled manner of an affronted host;
“are you blind as well as deaf, my dear?” he
asked curtly, “here are your guests!”</p>

<p>She turned haughtily and looked over her shoulder,
her smallest attitude always seeming to defy
him, while Fox had an uneasy feeling that he was
more acutely aware than usual to-night of the impossible
relations between the two. Meanwhile,
the entrance to the long room was already filling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
with the rapidly arriving throng which seemed,
to the casual observer, a mass of satin and jewels
and lavishly exposed necks and shoulders, with
here and there a sprinkling of the black coats of
the men.</p>

<p>In spite of this influx, however, the young hostess
stood a moment longer looking at them with
a glance of malicious amusement in her drooping
eyes, noting the whole effect of White’s large and
rather florid personality as he received the first
enthusiastic advance, responding genially to the
murmur of congratulations. Then she turned
and swept across the wide intervening space, her
small head thrown proudly back, her whole grace
of figure and dignity of pose—in direct contradiction
to her former wild gayety and audacity—at
once suggesting the <i>grande dame</i> assuming her
rightful and appropriate place. But Fox found
it impossible to as easily free himself from the
haunting sorrow of her beautiful haggard eyes.
Sometimes she seemed to him to be as fragile, as
exquisite and as perishable as a bit of delicately
carved ivory. Yet he was forced to dismiss the
analogy, for ivory, no matter how marvellously
carved in imitation of a living creature, is inanimate,
while she was the very personification of
unrest; it seemed rather that some wild and beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
sprite must have been enthralled into temporary
captivity, and was wearing its way to liberty
through the exquisite clay which had been fashioned
into human shape for its mortal disguise,
that the touch of inevitable sadness which sometimes
came upon her was the moment when the
sprite relapsed into the melancholia of prolonged
captivity.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a little past noon on Saturday when
Rose Temple went to Allestree’s studio accompanied
by Aunt Hannah Colfax, a faithful old
negro woman who had been devoted to her from
childhood and now performed the dual duties of
maid and duenna with all the complacence and
shrewdness of her age and color.</p>

<p>Passing the quaint show-windows of Daddy
Lerwick’s curiosity-shop on the first floor, in
which were displayed—in amazing medley—pewter
cups, old line engravings, camel’s-hair
shawls and horse-pistols, they ascended the long
narrow flight of stairs to the rooms above. On
reaching them, Aunt Hannah promptly ensconced
herself and her knitting under the window on the
landing, while Rose pushed aside the portière and
entered the studio, unconsciously carrying with
her some of the crisp out-of-door atmosphere from
whence she came and of which, in her buoyant and
radiant youth, she seemed a visible and triumphant
embodiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“It’s perfectly angelic of me to come to-day,
Robert,” she remarked, as she greeted him, “for
I’m not in the mood for a sitting and, of course,
I shall behave abominably.”</p>

<p>“And you wish me to be bowed in the dust
with gratitude for your angelic determination to
behave abominably?” he replied dryly, looking at
her with all an artist’s perception of her beauty
and a reluctant consciousness that the glow in
her eyes and the color in her cheeks were purely
responses to the keen winter air, and that neither
had ever been inspired by his presence nor called
into being by his words.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rose moved unconsciously before the
long mirror, and removing her hat, slightly and
deftly rearranged her beautiful and luxuriant
hair as she answered him. “Why not?” she
said banteringly; “you can’t believe that any one
likes to pose for an hour—even to be made into
one of your delightful pictures—but I’ll try to
behave beautifully if you’ll answer all my questions,
instead of going on with your painting,
with a cigarette between your teeth and with
the face of a sphinx, as you did the other
day!”</p>

<p>“When you asked a dozen questions I couldn’t
answer!” Allestree was selecting his brushes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
contemplating the canvas on his easel with a despairing
eye.</p>

<p>He had already outlined Rose’s figure and decided
on the desired pose, but it seemed to him
impossible to do justice to the exquisite charm of
her beauty. It was a simple picture; he had
endeavored to preserve what seemed to him the
keynote of her personality, and had forborne to
use any of those effects of brilliant color, rich
draperies and elaborate accessories which a portrait
painter commonly loves to lavish on a beautiful
subject; instead, he had made her figure,
with its superb poise, stand out in absolute simplicity.
To Allestree she personified all the glorious
possibilities of youth, with its buoyant
hopes, its poignant truth, its magnificent faith
in life, in the world, in itself. But when he looked
from her to the canvas—where he had hoped to
express something of all this—he felt deeply
discouraged; his brush might be touched with the
magic of a deep if unspoken passion, but it could
never paint her as she appeared to him!</p>

<p>“I do not remember asking anything but the
simplest questions,” she remarked, as she took her
seat in the carved armchair which he had placed
for her before a curtain of soft deep blue which
seemed to suggest an April sky; “only you didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
want to answer them. I warn you that I mean
to be answered to-day! There’s nothing so abominable
as your silences.”</p>

<p>Allestree smiled a little as he began to paint,
with a slow and reluctant touch, feeling his way
toward some achievement which might at least
foreshadow success. “I fancied there was a virtue
in silence; there’s a copy-book axiom to that effect,”
he remarked; “besides, you would never
come here at all punctually if you are not left in
doubt on some mooted point. Mystery lures a
woman as surely as magic.”</p>

<p>Rose gave him a reproachful glance. “And
you think I like to sit here and listen to Mammy
Hannah snore while you smoke and paint?” she
said in a vexed tone, “for you always smoke and
she always falls asleep.”</p>

<p>“Which is a special providence,” he retorted,
“and the greatest virtue I ever met in a duenna.”</p>

<p>Without replying Rose looked absently around
her, observing the details of his workshop more
carefully than usual and noticing the harmonious
effect of the colors, which he had grouped in his
hangings. There was the high northern light
concentrated on his subject, but beyond, in the
corners, there were invitingly rich shadows, and
here and there a bold, half finished sketch had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
nailed to the walls. A well worn Turkey rug
covered the portion of the floor occupied by his
model, and a table in the window was set with a
chafing-dish, a box of Egyptians and an odd
shaped bronze tea-pot with some egg-shell cups
which he had purchased in Japan. In a way Rose
knew the history of everything in the room and
almost the cost, but there was a touch of luxury
about it which vaguely irritated her; it often
seemed that Allestree was too well off to ever be a
great artist,—he lacked the spur of necessity.</p>

<p>“Shall you paint for a living if you are ever
poor?” she asked abruptly, resting her chin in
her hand and contemplating him with a clear and
impersonal gaze.</p>

<p>Allestree looked up, and observing the delicate
hand with its tapering fingers and the jewelled
chain which clasped her throat, smiled. “Shall
you sing?” he asked, amused.</p>

<p>She sighed softly. “I wish that I might—and
in opera too!” she replied, “I fear I should
to-day but for father. You think me a very useless
person, I see,” she added, smiling a little,
“and perhaps I am. But isn’t it because I’ve had
no chance? Girls are trained up in such an objectless
way unless they are brought up to marry.
Thank heaven, I escaped that; father is as innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of such designs as a baby! But if I had
been a boy I should have been given a profession,
I should have had something to do instead of
being expected merely to dress well and look ornamental!”</p>

<p>As she spoke her face lost a little of its vivid
color and animation, but the slight pensiveness
of her look seemed to Allestree to increase the
poignancy of her spell; there was a subtle suggestion
of that imaginative longing for the fulfilment
of those vague youthful conceptions of happiness
and life and love which stir in all young
things, as the sap stirs in the trees in springtime
and the bud forms under the leaves.</p>

<p>He did not immediately reply, but continued to
work on the portrait before him which seemed to
him more and more hopelessly colorless and lifeless
compared with his model. “Perhaps my
point of view is too concentrated to be of much
value,” he said at length; “to me the mere fact
of your existence seems enough to compensate for
the loss of a good many more actively employed
and earthly individuals who must be working out
your privileged season as a lily of the field.”</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, slightly amazed look,
and blushed. “You speak as though I were
selected from the rubbish heap!” she exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
laughing, “as though I profited by the misfortunes
of others. I don’t know whether to regard
it as a compliment or not!”</p>

<p>But Allestree was quite unmoved, absorbed indeed
in his work. “Did I ever pay you a compliment,
Rose?” he asked, after an instant, meeting
her glance with one that was so eloquent of
deeper feeling that she withdrew hers, vaguely
alarmed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you ever did,” she replied
hastily, with an instinctive desire to put off any
suggestion of passion on his part, for much as she
liked him and long as she had known him, Allestree
was only a lay figure on her horizon; he had
never stirred her heart, and she dreaded a break
in that friendship which she dreamed of prolonging
forever with a girl’s usual infatuated belief
in the possibilities of such a friendship between
a man and a woman. The channel into which
their talk had unconsciously drifted so alarmed
her indeed that she rose abruptly and went to the
window and stood looking down into the street,
her perfect profile and the soft upward sweep of
her beautiful hair showing against the dark
draperies which she had pushed aside, and moving
the painter in turn to still deeper depths of artistic
self-abasement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Robert,” she said suddenly, after a moment’s
embarrassed silence, “who was that with you the
other evening? Was it Mr. Fox?”</p>

<p>Allestree glanced up quickly, and then stooped
to pick up a brush which had dropped to the
floor. “Yes,” he said quietly, “how did you
happen to recognize him?”</p>

<p>“I was not sure—but I’ve seen two or three
pictures of him in the magazines and the weeklies.
One can’t forget his head, do you think?” and
she came slowly back to her chair, unconscious of
the change in Allestree’s expression.</p>

<p>“Well, I never tried,” he confessed; “I’ve
known William Fox all my life, and he’s my own
first cousin besides. It’s rather odd,” he added,
“by the way, that you never met him, but then
you have been away from the city when he has
been here.”</p>

<p>Rose regarded him thoughtfully, her composure
fully restored. “He has a very remarkable face,”
she observed, “and it is fine and pale like a bit
of old ivory.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, all the women fall in love with him,”
Allestree assented with impatient irony.</p>

<p>“Do they? That doesn’t sound interesting,
but I should not believe it of his face, he doesn’t
look like a lady’s man! Is it true—” she added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
with a moment’s hesitation—“that he has never
loved any one but Margaret White?”</p>

<p>“It’s true that Margaret treated him abominably,”
said Allestree bluntly; “she was engaged
to him when they were both very young and threw
him over to marry White.”</p>

<p>“What a singular choice,” Rose observed,
“White has nothing attractive about him, and
he is so selfish, so hard; they say he treats her
badly.”</p>

<p>“He should—in poetic justice,” replied Allestree
laughing, “for she married him for his
money and his position. Fox was a poor man then
with no prospects but his brains and, strange to
say, Margaret underestimated their possibilities.”</p>

<p>“And yet she is very clever. Did he really
feel it so much?” she added, her natural sympathy
for a sentimental situation touched and
strengthened by the remembrance of Fox’s clear-cut
face, which had appeared to her vision cameo-like
against the night.</p>

<p>“Now you are beginning to ask me your unanswerable
questions,” he retorted smiling grimly,
with a keen sense of annoyance that Fox could
intrude so sharply into their talk. “I know he
was very much in love with her then, but he is on
good terms with them both now and—” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
stopped abruptly; his quick ear had caught a
step on the stairs accompanied by another sound
which startled him with an impatient certainty of
a surprise.</p>

<p>It was the tread of a large Scotch collie who
lifted the portière on his nose and walked deliberately
into the room. Allestree laid down his brush
with a peculiarly exasperated expression.</p>

<p>“Well, Sandy,” he said, not unkindly, addressing
the dog.</p>

<p>Rose turned and held out her hand. “What a
beautiful creature,” she remarked; “who does he
belong to? Who is coming?”</p>

<p>Her companion gave her an enigmatical glance,
observing the collie as he approached and laid his
head against her knee. The step on the stair had
now reached the landing, and they heard Aunt
Hannah’s chair scrape as she moved and her knitting
needles rattled on the floor, for she had been
startled out of a nap.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” Rose repeated, framing the
question with her lips.</p>

<p>“Fox,” replied Allestree dryly, laying down his
palette and lighting a cigarette; “he has an uncommonly
retentive memory it appears.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him quickly, a suddenly illuminated
understanding in her eyes, and blushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
exquisitely, for she was still young enough to be
easily embarrassed. At the same moment Fox
pushed aside the portière and entered the room.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bobby,” he began, and then paused
abruptly at the sight of Rose. “I fear I’m an
intruder,” he added courteously.</p>

<p>Allestree smiled grimly and presented him to
Miss Temple. “On the contrary, I think you
got the time pretty closely,” he remarked ironically.</p>

<p>Fox laughed. “Guilty!” he exclaimed with
perfect good humor; “down Sandy!” he added
sharply to his collie; “you’ve bewitched the dog,
Miss Temple; he rarely makes friends with
strangers.”</p>

<p>“Then I appreciate all the more his advances,”
she replied smiling, “a dog always knows a
friend.”</p>

<p>“And an honest man,” said Fox; “I’m free
to confess that I don’t trust one who dislikes
dogs.”</p>

<p>“Every man has his crank,” remarked Allestree,
walking to and fro before his easel, “and if
you begin on dogs with William there’s no end.”</p>

<p>Rose laughed, glancing from Allestree’s
slightly vexed countenance to the serenity on
the brow of his cousin, who had seated himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
on the edge of an elaborate brass-bound chest
which was one of the studio properties. “I can
sympathize, Mr. Fox,” she said; “we’ve always
had dogs.”</p>

<p>Fox gave her one of his brilliant inscrutable
looks. “I entirely agree with Lamartine, Miss
Temple,” he replied; “when a man is unhappy
God gives him a dog.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, Billy, are you making a bid for
our sympathy?” exclaimed Allestree with exasperation.</p>

<p>Both Fox and Rose laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“He’s only quoting the modern classics,” she
replied gayly.</p>

<p>“What I should like to know is how he gets
out of school in the middle of the day,” said Allestree
dryly; “for a man who is supposed to be a
leader, he manages to desert at the most remarkable
moments. One of the party whips told me
the other day that Fox was as hard to trail as
a comet.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” replied Fox, with indolent
amusement; “we adjourned over, last
night, until Monday, and I came around here as
usual to sit for my portrait.”</p>

<p>Allestree bit his lip, conscious that his irritability
was thrown into sharp relief by his cousin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
imperturbable good humor, and resenting, with
a sting of premonition, the effect of Fox’s pose
upon Rose Temple. He was not a dull man and
could not close his eyes to the fact that she had
apparently come to life, been revivified and animated
by Fox’s entrance, and he knew well enough
the interest that the touch of romance in his past
history added to his cousin’s brilliant personality.
However, it was useless to sulk at the inevitable
misfortune which had destroyed his hour with
Rose, and he turned his attention to hospitality.</p>

<p>“Will you make tea for us, Rose, if I set the
kettle boiling?” he asked, as he drew forward
the table, “I’ve got some cakes in the cupboard
and a few sandwiches.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course; it will be delightful,” she
assented readily, rising from her chair to help him
find the tea caddy. “I’m eternally indebted, Mr.
Fox; he’s going to let me off a half-hour’s posing,”
she added, smiling over her shoulder at him.</p>

<p>He laughed, moving over apparently to study
the half outlined portrait on the easel, but really
enjoying the sight of the graceful figure bending
over the table, and her delicate hands engaged in
opening the caddy and measuring the tea into
Allestree’s old tea-pot. As she did so the light
from the window fell vividly on her bright head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and the exquisite details of her profile, the curve
of her cheek and chin, the thick lashed white eyelids,
the short upper lip, the little pink ear, all
engaged Fox’s critical and appreciative eye.
Like most men who are forced to live in bachelor
apartments, he felt keenly the domesticity of the
little scene and the touch of gracious femininity
which her presence lent to the tea-table. There
was a charm, too, in her unconsciousness, and he
was almost sorry when she finally turned with a
steaming cup in her hands.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to take lemon,” she said, “for
Robert never has cream unless it’s sour, but do
you take sugar?”</p>

<p>“He takes three lumps to a cup,” interposed
Allestree bluntly; “but he’ll probably deny it—he’s
a politician.”</p>

<p>Fox laughed. “And in the house of my
friends!” he said; “but that is only a <i>coup
d’état</i> on his part,” he added, “to keep me from
asking for his last lump, Miss Temple; I saw him
looking for more just now.”</p>

<p>“We’ll draw lots for it, Robert,” said Rose
gayly, taking her seat at the table and smiling
across at Fox from pure pleasure in the little
unconventional picnic.</p>

<p>But Allestree’s attention had been arrested by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
something in the street below, and he interrupted
them with a gesture of despair. “Mrs. Osborne
is coming!” he announced with a grimace.</p>

<p>Rose glanced hastily at the clock. “Oh, I
must be going,” she exclaimed; “I had no idea
it was so late!” and she rose hurriedly and
reached for her hat.</p>

<p>Allestree murmured something uncomplimentary
to his approaching visitor, and Fox set down
his cup of tea. The first tremor of an earthquake
shock could scarcely have broken up the little
group more abruptly. Rose had put on her hat
and adjusted her filmy veil, and it was Fox who
helped her with her coat and her furs. Allestree,
instead, threw a cloth over the picture on the
easel.</p>

<p>Rose held out her hand. “Good-by,” she said
with a charming smile; “I know I’m a trying
model, but you’re a perfect angel of patience,
Robert.”</p>

<p>As she spoke there was a frou-frou of skirts in
the hall, and Lily Osborne came slowly and gracefully
through the portière. She was a handsome
woman with an abundance of reddish gold hair
and long black eyes which had the effect of having
no white, a peculiarity possessed by Rachel and
also, we are told, by the devil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>The two women bowed stiffly and Rose slipped
out, attended by Fox and Sandy, leaving Allestree
to devour his chagrin and receive his accomplished
visitor.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALLESTREE lived alone with his widowed
mother in a roomy, old-fashioned mansion
in one of the older residential sections,
which stand now like decadent environs of the
more brilliant quarters where the millionaire and
the multi-millionaire erect their palaces. But
these changes, in matters of fashion and display,
did not trouble the serene bosom of old Mrs.
Allestree, who felt that she held her place in the
world by the inalienable rights of birth, blood, and
long established family position, for, happily, she
had as yet no notion of the shadowy nature of
such claims in the event of financial disaster,
which is as impersonal as the deluge. She was
contentedly aware that her old-fashioned drawing-rooms
had been the scene of many a brilliant
gathering even before her nephew, William Fox,
became such a figure in the public eye that his
frequent presence in her house was enough to draw
there the most distinguished and representative
men at the capital. But the old lady herself was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
clever, shrewdly conversant with the world and its
affairs, and not averse to giving ear to the current
gossip; she was, indeed, often amused at her
son’s aloofness from these worldly concerns which
pleased and interested her the most. For, though
a detached spectator, because of her age and her
comparatively delicate health, she was yet keenly
aware of the drift of events both social and political,
and possessed the advantages of age in being
able to make comparisons between the past and
the present, with a touch of eclecticism amusing
in one who had been so devotedly attached to the
frivolities of fashion. She could draw more accurate
deductions than many who were more intimately
concerned in the whirling conflict of
social and political ambitions which was raging
around her. When the President quarrelled with
the party leaders, when Congress administered a
rebuke by withholding a vote of confidence, she
was able to recall this or that parallel case,
this or that precedent for an action which to
many seemed unprecedented, and when the entertainments
at the White House began to
evolve a new system of exclusions she could
point out an incident when some former President’s
wife had tried to introduce a similar measure
and had met with disaster on leaving her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
stronghold, lost at once in the current of a social
millrace which whirls to oblivion the queen of
yesterday and the leader of to-day, engulfing all
past glories in a maelstrom of forgetfulness; the
inevitable condition in a republican society where
there can be no hereditary distinction and those
of class are constantly fluctuating with the rise
and fall of fortunes, the manipulations of the
Stock Exchange, while birth and breeding have
no consideration at all in comparison with the
purchase power of gold.</p>

<p>Fully aware of these things, and rejoicing in
the rich memories of a varied past, when she had
known all the great men of her day, old Mrs.
Allestree delighted in observing the world of
fashion from her retired corner and, though devoted
to her son and admiring and believing in
his talent, she sometimes suffered a keen pang of
regret that her sister and not she had borne
William Fox. But she was jealously afraid of
this secret thought, scarcely admitting it even to
herself, because of her intuitive feeling that Allestree
had already suffered and might suffer more
at the hands of his brilliant and careless cousin,
and that he was supremely gifted in the refinements
of self-torture.</p>

<p>It was twilight, and Mrs. Allestree sat alone by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
her drawing-room window watching for her son’s
return from his workshop. She had been a very
handsome woman, and even in age retained much
of her beauty and dignity, and her figure and
face were finely outlined as she sat against the
folds of heavy velvet curtains, looking down into
the street where the lamps had just been lighted
and shone with the vivid whiteness of electricity
on the smooth pavements, while the carriages and
motor-cars were beginning to wheel by on their
return from afternoon receptions, teas, and matinées.
Below, at the circle, she saw the gayly
lighted electric cars sweeping around the curve
and receding to a final vanishing point of light
at the top of a distant hill, while above it the sky
was still bright with the afterglow and one star
shone like the tip of a naked sword. The city in
this retired quarter showed its most kind and
friendly aspect, suggesting nothing of the struggle
and rush of modern life, but only the whirl of
winter gayety, the ceaseless rounds of society.</p>

<p>Within was an atmosphere of repose and comfort;
the tea-table was set by the open fire, and
the rose-patterned, silver tea kettle was emitting
a little cloud of steam when Allestree finally opened
the door.</p>

<p>“Well, mother, you here alone in the dark?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
he remarked, as he turned on some light and revealed
the warm homeliness of the large old-fashioned
room, with its mahogany furniture, its soft
rugs and velvet hangings, and its long, oval mirrors
framed in gold and surmounted by cupids
and lovers’ knots.</p>

<p>“Never less alone than when alone,” she replied
brightly, and then glancing shrewdly at his
slightly perturbed expression, she added: “you’ll
take some tea, you look tired.”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, throwing himself into an
easy chair by the fire; “Rose made some tea in
the studio, and it’s a bit too late now for another
cup.”</p>

<p>“So Rose kept her appointment? I hope you
got on with the portrait.”</p>

<p>Allestree shrugged his shoulders. “Impossible,
Fox came and then Lily Osborne. The gods
don’t mean that I shall finish that picture. And
Reynolds painted several of his best in eight
hours!” he added despairingly.</p>

<p>But his mother ignored the latter part of his
speech. “Fox?” she glanced at him keenly,
“then the House adjourned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he knew Rose was to be there,”
Allestree laughed a little bitterly; “it was the
merest chance in the world, he was with me when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
I met her the other day. Of course he came in as
handsome, as gay as ever—and as careless!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree had left her seat by the window
and was mechanically pouring out a cup of tea,
her fine old hands under their falls of lace as firm
and deft as a girl’s. “I wish he was less careless,”
she observed quietly; “I’ve just heard
some more gossip about him; Martha O’Neal was
here to lunch. It appears that he was really
selected for the Navy, could have had the portfolio
for the lifting of his finger and, at the last
moment, when there was no apposite reason for
a change, there was a deal and White got it.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t blame him for that, can we?”
said her son smiling, “you know the saying is
that the Administration will not ‘stand hitched.’”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “That’s not it—he made
the deal himself; he deliberately favored White,
and you can imagine what is said; every one believes
that silly story that he’s desperately in love
with Margaret still, and, of course, it looks like
it. He could have saved Wingfield, and he didn’t,
and you know Mrs. Wingfield hates Margaret!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” said Allestree
calmly; “Fox is too much of an egoist. Probably
he didn’t want to go into the Cabinet; in
fact I’ve heard him say it was a safe receiving-vault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> 
for the defunct candidates. Can’t the
women ever forget that he was in love with Margaret?”</p>

<p>“Possibly they could,” his mother replied
shrewdly, “if Margaret wasn’t in love with him.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, how you all flatter Fox!” her son
exclaimed, with exasperation, “for my part, I
can’t fancy that Margaret ever loved him; she
treated him abominably to marry White, and now
she has everything she wants, money, luxury and
power; she’s a perfect little sybarite.”</p>

<p>The old woman looked at him with an expression
of affectionate tolerance. “My dear boy,”
she said quietly, “Margaret is wildly unhappy;
money never yet purchased happiness; that’s the
reason she behaves so outrageously. Have you
heard of her latest? She danced a kind of highland
fling or a jig after her dinner the other
night. White was furious, and they’re telling a
story of an open quarrel after the musicale when
he swore at her and she laughed in his face.”</p>

<p>“White is a brute, but Margaret chose him
with her eyes open,” he replied, “and I think Fox
feels it. At any rate there’s nothing in that gossip
about Wingfield; he had quarrelled with the
President. You know the story is that he was
found walking up and down his hall, the Wednesday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
after Congress met, shaking his fist and
shouting about the message. ‘That damned
message!’ he said, ‘it will ruin the party—if I’d
only been here!’ He was away at the time it was
written and, of course, that paragraph did virtually
condemn his administration of the department.
He had to resign; that goes without saying!”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, and Mrs. Wingfield talked; we
all know what a tongue she has!”</p>

<p>Allestree laughed, leaning back in his chair
with his hands clasped behind his head. “Well,
she’s going, anyway.”</p>

<p>“But she isn’t,” sighed Mrs. Allestree; “she’s
to stay over two months, heaven knows why!”</p>

<p>“The Lord deliver Margaret then!” exclaimed
her son, still laughing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree nodded sagely. “Margaret can
hold her own though, Robert, and everybody
knows how she has insulted Mrs. Wingfield. Margaret’s
<i>bon mots</i> have convulsed the town time
and again. You know, as well as I do, that it was
Margaret who set half the stories going about
her. Margaret can do and say the most shocking
and heartless things at one moment and be the
most charming creature at the next. She often
seems to me to be a perfect Undine, to have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
soul! Really, sometimes her treatment of White
is impossible. Even Lily Osborne professes to be
shocked at the dance the other night; she told
Martha O’Neal that it was as suggestive as
Salome.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Osborne is a hypocrite,” retorted Allestree
scornfully; “by the way, I’m to paint her
portrait. I put it at a figure which, I thought,
was prohibitive and precluded all possibility of
an order, but she closed it at once, without turning
an eyelash.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree gave him a long, comprehending
look. “White pays for it then,” she remarked
dryly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he replied, “and White pretends
to quarrel with his wife’s wild ways!”</p>

<p>The old woman set down her teacup and looked
mournfully into the fire. “It’s a terrible business
from beginning to end,” she said finally; “when
I think of those two poor babies! Little Estelle
is just beginning to notice things too, and Margaret
seems utterly indifferent to them. What
is the world coming to?”</p>

<p>Allestree laughed and patted his mother’s hand.
“You can’t regulate it, mother,” he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid! There are too many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
divorces; one can’t go out now without meeting
men with two wives and women with a plurality
of husbands; yet we are objecting to seating the
Mormons in Congress!”</p>

<p>“After all, is a divorce worse than such a
marriage as Margaret’s?” her son rejoined, indolently
enjoying the controversy.</p>

<p>“There should have been no marriage,” she retorted
firmly, pushing back her chair and rising
with a rustle of silks, “White could never have
loved her, he hasn’t been true to her for a moment.
Her beauty pleased him, or that charm
which is more subtle than beauty and which makes
her what she is. Now he’s lost his head over the
gorgeous coloring, the flesh and blood of Lily
Osborne; she would have pleased Rubens, Robert.
By the way, Martha O’Neal told me of a curious
rumor about her; it is said that she is in the
secret employ of the Russian Government; you
know she has no conscience.”</p>

<p>“A spy?” Allestree laughed, “but why here?
We’ve done Russia a good turn, it’s Japan that
is chewing the rag.”</p>

<p>“Robert! what a disgusting expression. But
of course you know the tales of the Black Cabinet
and that our embassy dispatches were tampered
with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“Now you’re in your element, mother; you love
a mystery!”</p>

<p>The old woman put her hand on his head, stroking
back his hair with a fond gesture. “Tell me
about Rose,” she said, watching him narrowly,
with all her maternal intuition alive; “did she sit
patiently—and will your portrait please you?
That’s really the only question; every one else is
sure to be pleased.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “I can’t get it to please
me,” he replied quietly; “after all, Rose’s beauty
is less a question of feature than I thought. I
might interpret a soul if I were a Raphael or a
Fra Angelico—as it is, it will never look like
her.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Rose is very human; don’t put
her on too high a pedestal, my dear,” his mother
counselled wisely; “you are too sensitive, too
imaginative. Fox would never make the mistake
of treating a woman like a saint on a pillar!”</p>

<p>Allestree made an inarticulate sound and rose
also. “Fox—no!” he said a little bitterly;
“Fox could make love to Saint Catherine without
offending her; he’s one of the men whom women
love!”</p>

<p>His mother smiled but made no reply; at heart
she was fully aware that there was much truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
in the saying. Old as she was, she felt the indescribable
spell of Fox’s genius, and knowing her
son’s heart as she did, she foresaw difficulties in
the way of his happiness if his cousin should forget
his old love and find a new one. Much as she
had desired and endeavored to break up the unfortunate
intimacy between Fox and the Whites,
she had not foreseen that her own son’s happiness
might be, in a way, dependent on Margaret’s
power to hold her place in the regard of her early
lover. As she stood looking at the fire in silence
the shrewd old woman reflected that the ways of
Providence are inscrutably hard to divine and
that, after all, it is sometimes fatal to thrust one’s
hand into the fire to save a brand from the burning.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT Mrs. Allestree’s divinations were not
very far short of the truth, or unlikely of
fulfilment, would have been apparent to her
could she have looked in, a few weeks later, on
Rose and Fox together in Judge Temple’s fine
old library. In the judge’s estimation the library
was the one spot of the house, the sanctum sanctorum,
and its noble book-lined walls imparted a
warmth of color and an erudite dignity to a room
of fine proportions lighted by an immense southern
bow-window which overlooked the walled garden,
where Rose had cultivated every flower which
blooms in summer and every evergreen vine and
ilex which lives in winter.</p>

<p>Over the high wide mantel was one fine old
painting which testified both to the extravagance
and distinctive taste of the judge’s grandfather,
and on the book littered table stood a slender vase
filled with roses. There was an exquisite delicacy,
a refinement, an atmosphere of culture, even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
such minutiæ as these, which gave a detailed charm
to the perspective of the entire house.</p>

<p>Rose herself sat in a high-backed chair by the
open fire, her bright head and slender figure outlined
against the dark background, while she listened,
with all the freshness and enthusiasm of
girlhood, to Fox’s gay, easy talk, his dog, Sandy,
lying stretched on the hearthrug between them
in the blissful content of physical comfort and the
instinctive assurance of safety and friendship
which Rose’s presence seemed to increase.</p>

<p>To Fox, half the girl’s charm lay in a certain
rigid mental uprightness, a clear ethical point of
view, which was entirely different from the careless
tolerance of the smart set in which he had hitherto
almost exclusively moved. Fox had no religion;
Rose was devout, and swift in her denunciation of
wrong, for she had all the terrible unrelenting
standards of youth and the religion of youth
which is wont to be the religion of extremes. Her
character was indeed just emerging from that raw
period of girlhood which is full of passionate beliefs
and renunciations as well as a shy pride
which can inflict keen mental suffering for a little
hurt; a season when the mind is wonderfully receptive
and the young, untried spirit full of beautiful
inspirations, hopes, and beliefs which are too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
frequently destined to woeful annihilation in later
years.</p>

<p>Fox had recently made a great speech, a speech
which had filled both the floor and the galleries of
the House to suffocation, and even thronged the
corridors with spectators who could gain no admittance,
yet, while it had thrilled Rose’s pulses
with excitement and enthralled her with the spell
of its eloquence, her rigid sense of the proprieties
had been shocked; she had felt its flowing periods
its scornful references to mysteries which seemed
to Fox as rotten as they were immaterial, and the
fact that she had taken umbrage at phrases of his,
which seemed to him sufficiently innocuous to escape
all criticism, amused and pleased him. It
was a new point of view; he liked to tease her into
expressing a shy opinion, or into a sudden outburst
of righteous disapproval which brought the
color to her cheek and the sparkle to her eye. It
delighted him to feel that even disapproving of
him she could not hate him, for in their dawning
intimacy he found ample assurance of her liking,
and the unguarded friendliness of her feeling
showed in her eagerness to win him to her side on
any mooted question.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, watching her with
a keen appreciation of her loveliness and her unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
betrayal of her own emotions. “So!
after all you didn’t approve of me the other day?”
he said, with perfect good humor; “you were
really condemning my ethics while you applauded—you
know you did applaud, you told me you
congratulated me on my ‘great speech.’”</p>

<p>Rose returned his teasing look seriously. “I
did congratulate you; it was a great speech, but
I didn’t like it,” she said in a low voice and with
an evident effort.</p>

<p>“And why?” he asked, his brilliant gaze bent
more fully on her.</p>

<p>She turned away, her cheek red, and resting her
chin on her hand she fell to studying the fire
though she was still courageous. “I didn’t like
the tone of it; you belittle your own great gifts,”
she said softly, hesitating slightly and choosing
her words with care; “you make them of your
own creation when they are really given you,
given you as the five talents were given to the
man in the Scriptures. You haven’t laid them
away in a napkin; why then are you ashamed to
give the glory where it is justly due? You can’t
deny that there is glory in it all!”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You make me feel like a thief.
To be entirely honest, I’m not religious, but I
read the Bible and Shakespeare as dictionaries of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
eloquence. Do you think me a dreadful sinner—worse
than those on whom the tower of Siloam
fell?”</p>

<p>Rose bit her lip. “I’ve no doubt you think me
a hypocrite!” she replied.</p>

<p>“I should like to tell you what I think of you,”
he said softly, leaning forward, his elbows on his
knees, looking across at her, “but I’m afraid—afraid
of you!”</p>

<p>She laughed a little with a charming diffidence,
for she had met the sweetness of his glance which
was full of gentle admiration.</p>

<p>“I sometimes wonder,” he continued, “how you
would meet a great moral question which involved
your happiness and, perhaps, that of another
whom you loved.”</p>

<p>She shivered a little, stretching out one slender
hand to the fire. “Ah,” she said, with a faint
smile, “I hope I may never meet such a question!
I see you make me a Pharisee.”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” he replied quickly, “you belong
rather to the Christian martyrs; I’m either
a Barbarian or a Scythian!”</p>

<p>They both laughed softly at this, and Rose
forgot her momentary embarrassment. “I should
try to be just!” she said.</p>

<p>He shook his head with that rare smile of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
which seemed half mocking, half caressing. “You
couldn’t be!” he retorted provokingly, “you are
a little Puritan, narrow, firm, righteous; I begin
to be more and more afraid of you!”</p>

<p>She lifted her chin. “You think me too narrow
to be just? Isn’t that the charge that you
worldlings always bring against—against—”</p>

<p>“The righteous?” he supplied quickly.</p>

<p>They laughed again. “You convict me out of
my own mouth; I shall dare no more arguments!”</p>

<p>“Ah, now you know how I feel under your criticisms!”
he flashed back at her.</p>

<p>His manner wore its happiest aspect, it was delightful
to be with her; through all contradictions
he began to feel the temperamental sympathy,
and she, too young to understand these
subtleties, was aware of the glow and warmth of
his presence, the sweetness of his manner which
could be, when he was neither stern nor angry nor
self-absorbed, one of a delicacy and sentiment uncommon
in a man; with all his egotism, his
spoiled acceptance of the world’s homage, he retained
qualities that were inherently noble and
lovable.</p>

<p>“But I have more reason,” she declared with
warmth, “it’s unworthy of you to espouse any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
cause for the mere sake of party, ‘to stand pat’
when your heart is against the issue; I don’t believe
in it!”</p>

<p>“You have been reading revolutionary documents;
you are full of this new heresy,” he retorted,
still laughing softly; “you are like some
of the new politicians; they pull down the pillars
of the temple on their own heads.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward eagerly, her eyes sparkling.
“Do you know what this party worship reminds
me of?” she said, “this devotion in a man to his
party? The tomb of Rosicrucius and the statue
which crushed the worshipper who entered there!
So your party’s graven image crushes out a man’s
originality.”</p>

<p>“Little heretic!” he mocked, “little revolutionist!
A party is a great machine; we can’t
do without it!”</p>

<p>She shook her head vehemently. “The children
of Israel thought they couldn’t do without
the golden calf! You were not so strong a party
man five years ago, do you remember?”</p>

<p>He looked at her quickly. “Do you?”</p>

<p>“I read your speeches,” she confessed with
charming ingenuousness, her eyes kindling with
emotion; “I read the first speech they ever
printed in the newspapers here. I’ve wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
tell you how beautiful I thought it, how eloquent!”</p>

<p>He regarded her a moment in silence; he felt
suddenly that there had always been a link between
them, that across space and time he had
spoken not to the public but to her, and even been
understood by her; that the virgin whiteness of
her young soul had received the inscription of his
mind. Then he was as suddenly and vividly conscious
of his folly, his egotism, his unworthiness!
She was too lovely and too innocent to have received
the impression of his spirit; and he—the
thought of his careless life, his worship at Margaret’s
shrine, the strength of the old fetters which
bound him, made him suddenly humble. And then,
the beauty of her smile, the warm sympathy of
her temperament created an angry impatience of
such restrictions; with characteristic scorn of
conventionalities he thrust them aside. The perfect
innocence and spontaneity of her praise and
appreciation was the most subtle of all flattery,
and he possessed the temperament of genius which
is, at one moment, above the consideration of
either praise or blame and the next quivers with
sensibility at the breath of either. He returned
her shy but glowing look with one of unusual
humility. “I feel as if I didn’t deserve it,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
said gently; “it is an exquisite happiness to be
praised by you!”</p>

<p>She smiled. “And I feel ashamed to have set
myself up as a judge,” she replied quickly, “but
it was because—because I didn’t want you to fall
below your own standard! You see what it is to
have a record of great achievements.”</p>

<p>“Hereafter I shall only seek to deserve your
praise,” he rejoined, “but I feel myself a sublime
egoist; I’ve sat here talking of myself, of my
work, and meanwhile I remember that my aunt
told me of your voice. Why do you never sing
for me?”</p>

<p>“Because you have never asked me,” she replied
simply, with an involuntary smile.</p>

<p>Fox leaned toward her with an eloquent gesture
of appeal. “Did I deserve that? Am I such a
miserable egoist?” he exclaimed, and then: “I
ask you now.”</p>

<p>Rose was entirely unaffected, and she went at
once to the piano in the room beyond, and seating
herself began to play the first soft notes of a
prelude. Fox had followed her and took his place
near the instrument, again observing her with
keen appreciation; her sweetness, her whiteness
of soul had taken possession of his imagination
with a force which he had supposed, until this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
moment, impossible. For, after one bitter and
humiliating experience in the drama of love and
passion, he had withdrawn with seared sensibilities,
and assuming a new attitude had regarded
women as a detached spectator, fancying that he
possessed a high degree of eclecticism in comparing
the emotional phases of their existence which
should be henceforth quite apart from his; love
and marriage were mere episodes in a man’s life,
and feeling no need of assuming either the duties
or the responsibilities of the latter state he had
not seriously contemplated the former as anything
but a remote possibility. Besides, in a curious
way, his life seemed to be linked with Margaret
White’s; she continued to make claims upon
him, to tacitly presuppose his devotion, and he
had been too uncertain of himself, too indolent, too
easily drifting with the tide to make any effort to
free himself from the shackles of that old love
affair. But all these things slipped out of mind
as he sat listening to Rose’s song.</p>

<p>It was a simple Italian love-song, soft, caressing,
gently plaintive, and peculiarly suited to her
voice, but the air and the words were nothing
compared with that voice. When Mrs. Allestree
spoke of it, Fox had thought of it as the usual
vocal accomplishment of a raw schoolgirl, something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
young and sweet, no doubt, but full of
crudity and weakness. Instead, he was suddenly
aware that he was listening to a voice which had a
scope and richness beyond any that he had ever
heard except in opera, and there were but few of
the great singers who had such a gift as this. The
thrill and exquisite freshness of its tones touched
his very soul. He found himself listening with a
keen feeling of depression; this gift of hers lifted
her at once into another sphere than his, and he
reflected that her beautiful body was an exquisite
envelope for the spirit, her voice its divine interpretation.</p>

<p>His mind drifted back to the sweeter and more
sacred relations of life, to those simple emotions
which approach more nearly the divine. The complex
affairs of the world, of politics, passion, intrigue,
slipped away from him, and the holier
aspects of a pure and devoted life took visible
shape to his imagination in this young and beautiful
girl. He had never fully appreciated his
own susceptibility to the uplifting power of music,
and the charm of her voice seemed more poignant
because so unexpected; he lost himself in a delightful
revery, the poet in him awoke with a thrill
of pleasure,—the joy we feel in discovering a
new power, a larger grasp; he was no longer conscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
of his surroundings, but only of the supreme
delight of her presence.</p>

<p>As she finished singing, her hands slipped from
the keys into her lap and she turned and looked
at him, smiling, expecting some applause, unconscious
of the depth of his emotion. For a moment
he said nothing, then he rose and held out his
hand, his eyes eloquent of feeling.</p>

<p>“Exquisite!” he said, and she blushed with
pleasure, knowing that he could not express his
appreciation in words.</p>

<p>She laid her hand in his, rising too. “Thank
you,” she exclaimed, “I’m so glad!”</p>

<p>As she spoke and while he still held her hand,
intending to tell her how profoundly she had
moved him, they were both suddenly aware of some
one’s entrance, and turned to see Mrs. White
standing just inside the drawing-room door. She
had entered unannounced, and stopped abruptly
as she came upon the little scene. She was elaborately
dressed in black velvet with ermine furs,
and an immense bizarre hat of violet velvet and
chiffon with masses of violets on the wide brim.
Under her arm was a toy Pomeranian as black as
her gown and as glossy as silk, its little black head
just appearing over her immense ermine muff.
She had evaded the servant’s intention of announcing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
her, she had thought only of surprising Rose
at her music and had come upon this! She stood
still, a sudden spiritual perception sweeping over
her and thrusting a blade of agony into her heart.
Every vestige of color ran out of her cheeks, her
gray eyes dilated. When they turned they surprised
a look on her face which distorted its usual
gayety and defiance. Then she thrust it aside
with a great effort of will, with the force of a
new and vivid determination, and greeted their
amazement with her light little laugh.</p>

<p>“Caught!” she said, “next time I shall send
a footman—or ring a bell!”</p>

<p>Rose came forward with a blushing but eager
welcome, but Fox stood in a moment of awkwardness
which both vexed and amused the woman.
Men have no resources, she thought bitterly.</p>

<p>As for him he experienced a shock of dismay;
he was trying to shake off a vague feeling which
possessed him that he had no right to be there,
that he owed allegiance still to Margaret, that
her look, her manner, her very presence demanded
it while, in fact, she had long ago forfeited all
claims upon him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she had led the way back to the
library, driven Sandy away from her Pomeranian,
and was seated in Rose’s chair, an elegant and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
conspicuously important figure, at once the centre
of the stage; she had one of those personalities
which are immediately predominant in society.
“So,” she said lightly, “this is why William deserted
my Sunday afternoons; I should have
looked for him in vain!”</p>

<p>“It seems you are yourself a deserter,” Fox
retorted, “this is your day at home.”</p>

<p>“You thought me safely anchored?” she
laughed, with a little mocking intonation, caressing
the Pomeranian’s ears; “I should be, but I
had to make a call of condolence. Wicklow insisted;
you know he’s so conventional and so
determined upon being the popular public man!
Mrs. Wingfield lost her grandmother two weeks
ago so, of course, I must call and make my condolences!”</p>

<p>Fox laughed softly; her manner brought back
the normal tone of affairs and he knew her moods
to perfection. “Of course you condoled?” he
said.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulder, looking at Rose.
“My dear,” she said, “you will be interested; no
mere man could understand. I’ve always been uncertain
in my mind about the correct mourning
for a grandmother; now I know,—it’s settled
beyond appeal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“By Mrs. Wingfield?” Rose smiled her incredulity.</p>

<p>“By Mrs. Wingfield—it’s shrimp pink!”
Margaret said, “she had on a tea-gown with lace
ruffles; it was a violent, vivid shrimp pink, and
her nose was red. Of course I said all manner of
appropriate things. Everybody stared, then I
made a grand finale and departed. She was furious.
And Wicklow sends me out to make his way
for him!” and she threw out her hands with a
little gesture of mock despair.</p>

<p>“Why do you tease that poor soul so?” Rose
protested laughing, “she falls an easy prey, too.
I heard they were going abroad soon.”</p>

<p>“In three months,” Margaret said, “to the
Riviera; they tried Switzerland, she told me, a
year ago, but she found ‘it wasn’t really fashionable.’”</p>

<p>“Margaret!” Rose shook an admonishing
finger, “you make her say such things, you know
you do!”</p>

<p>Mrs. White raised her eyebrows, her eyes haggard.
“One would suppose me a Sapphira. She
truly said it and I kept on asking her what she
said; she repeated it twice,—they were all listening
of course, and M. de Caillou tried to look
plaintive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“He’s solemn enough anyway, Margaret,” Fox
said, amused; “he might well be shocked at your
levity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I always want to make him sit up and
beg for a lump of sugar,” she retorted scornfully.</p>

<p>As she spoke she rose and went to the window,
looking out with an abruptness of manner which
seemed to take no account of their presence. She
was struggling with an overwhelming dread; with
the keen intuition of unhappiness she read Fox’s
mood, and her very soul cried out against it. But
she was an actress, an actress of long training and
accomplishment. She turned carelessly, lifting her
Pomeranian to her shoulder and resting her cheek
against its long black fur. “There’s my motor
back,” she said, catching a glimpse of it through
the long window in the drawing-room. “I’m going
home to receive Wicklow’s public. Can I borrow
Fox, Rose?”</p>

<p>Rose turned easily, mistress of herself and
aware of his annoyance, keenly alive to the possibility
that his old love for Margaret might still
be a factor in his life. “I’m afraid I haven’t
asked Mr. Fox to take a cup of tea,” she said
laughing; “father is late and you know we dine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
early on Sundays; we’re very unconventional and
old-fashioned.”</p>

<p>Margaret was trailing slowly to the door, her
velvet draperies and her long ermine stole seeming
heavy and burdensome on her slender figure.
“Oh, I know,” she retorted, “you’re Old Testament
Christians; I’m always expecting to see the
scapegoat caught in your fence-railing! In spite
of my shortcomings though, you are going to
sing for me some Sunday, Rose, and make my
sinners think they’ve found the gate of Paradise.”</p>

<p>But Rose shook her head, laughing. “Ask
father,” she said; “he declares that I shall not
exhibit!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MAMMA, give me the beads!”</p>

<p>Margaret turned reluctantly and
looked down at the child, a girl between
five and six years old, without even the
ephemeral beauty of babyhood, and showing already
a strong resemblance to her father. “By
all means, only don’t swallow them; it’s after the
doctor’s office hours,” she replied carelessly.</p>

<p>She was seated before her toilet-table clad in a
silk kimono, and her maid had just finished doing
her hair and gone in search of some minor accessories
of the toilet, for her mistress was dressing
for a large dinner at Mrs. O’Neal’s. Meanwhile
Margaret sat looking into the oval mirror in front
of her, making a keen and critical survey of her
own face and figure. As she did so she moved a
candle slightly, and thus throwing a stronger
light on her features was startled by the haggard
look in her eyes, the purple rings beneath them,
the hollowing of her cheeks. Was she beginning
to lose her beauty? The thought alarmed her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and she leaned forward looking at herself more
closely. Yes, there were lines, and she was thin,
deplorably, unquestionably thin. The vivid misery
of her expression in this unguarded moment
was apparent even to her. Heavens, did she look
like that to others? The thought was pregnant
with fierce mortification; she must be wearing her
heart upon her sleeve! And Fox? Was she losing
him? The keen pang of agony which had
shot through her at the sight of Fox and Rose
together, at the glimpse of that little scene by the
piano, recurred to her with a burning sense of
humiliation. Was she to taste this bitter cup
also?</p>

<p>She had known for years the miserable mistake
of her choice of White, she had grovelled in the
dust of repentance, but there had been one drop of
honey in the cup of gall, one saving grace in the
situation; she was sure that Fox still loved her,
that he would be true to her. No other woman
had been set up in her shrine. She knew how deep
the hurt had been, and she had fondly believed
that she alone could heal it. Through all those
arid years, those years of gayety, of luxury, of
false happiness and false show, she had hugged
her secret to her heart; Fox still loved her!</p>

<p>And now? What had she read in the kindled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
sympathy of that look at Rose Temple? She bit
her lip, staring into the mirror with haggard eyes.
Could he give her up? She, who knew so much
of the brutal egotism of which a man can be capable,
she who had seen such a nature as White’s
revealed in the scorching intimacy of married life,—dared
she picture Fox as unselfish enough to be
still true to her, to content himself with comforting
her wretchedness when love and youth and
beauty—beauty such as she had never worn—might
be his? Her sore heart throbbed passionately
in her bosom. She had expiated her mistake,
she had suffered for her fault, she had a right to
be happy! She would be happy; it is the eternal
cry of the human soul. “Every pitifullest whipster,”
says Carlyle, “seeks happiness, a happiness
impossible even for the gods.” And Margaret’s
wilful soul cried out for happiness; why should it
not be hers? She was shackled, it was true, with
fetters of her own forging, but—the eager
thought of liberty darted through her mind like
an arrow—others had been so bound and were
now free, others were making new lives out of the
old, and the ease with which such ties can be dissolved
was not the least of her temptations.</p>

<p>Her glance fell suddenly on the child, Estelle,
playing soberly with the amethyst beads which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
she had begged for. The little girl had learned
to be quiet; if she was noisy or in the way she was
immediately dismissed to the nursery, and she had
her lesson by heart; she was making no noise but
a soft crooning sound as she fondled the beads.
Her hair was flaxen, her face dull and not pretty,
her eyes like her father’s. Margaret shuddered
and averted her gaze; how cruel that she should
look like him! And the baby, only two years old
but already like him; she felt it her curse, the
retribution of her loveless marriage, that these
two living and visible links to bind her to her vows
were both like the man she had married without
love and without respect, because she could not
give up her life and its luxuries to be poor. A
marriage with Fox then would have meant the
renunciation of everything which seemed to her
essential to existence, it would have combined the
miseries of cheap living and self-denial, of small
and hideous economies, which made her shudder
even to contemplate; she had always been a sybarite.
Brought up by an extravagant, pleasure-loving
mother, by a father who had spent all to
live well, Margaret had been unable to conceive
anything more horrible than genteel poverty, and
White had offered her a dazzling vista of wealth,
position, social success. She was very young,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
raw, untried, and the temptation had been too
great.</p>

<p>As she sat there, idly, at her toilet-table, surrounded
by all the beautiful and splendid luxuries
of a boudoir which had been fitted up with reckless
expense to meet her whims and self-indulgences,
she remembered with keen self-contempt
her excitement over her own magnificent wedding,
her tour through France and Italy in a motor-car
which had cost a fortune; then a keen pang
wrung her heart as she remembered the boy they
had killed in the little crooked Italian village and
the people who had stoned them! She had felt it
then as a cruel prognostication of ill luck, a terrible
beginning of her married life and now, whenever
she closed her eyes, she could see again the
narrow street, the brown Italian houses, that
seemed ready to topple over on them, the children
playing, the vivid sky above—then the cry, the
awful scene, the child’s dead face. She shuddered;
so had her gilded dream of happiness ended; a
cry, a rush of misery, and now her sore heart to
hide, the dance of death to go on to the end
unless—again came the haunting thought; it
had beset her lately, tempted her, teased her. It
was so easy, it would be so easy to break the
bonds, and who could blame her? To be happy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Mamma, it broke!” Estelle cried suddenly,
with a quivering lip, “I didn’t do it!”</p>

<p>Margaret turned and looked at her. “No
matter,” she said strangely, “it broke easily,
didn’t it, Estelle? Thank heaven, one can break
chains!”</p>

<p>As she spoke there was a knock at her door,
and White himself entered. He was not a large
man but his face was broad and heavy, his hair
had been light but was now gray above the ears,
and his jaws were slightly purpled by high
living. There were some who thought him distinguished,
chiefly those who always perceive a
halo around officialdom and wealth. Actually he
belonged to that type of man who has been in
clubs, political and social, from boyhood, who has
unlimited money, a mighty egotism and the unfailing
preference for his neighbor’s wife. Meeting
Margaret’s challenging glance he paused near
the door, his hand on a chair, and looked at her
with a cold fixed eye which neither changed nor
wavered as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I have something to say to you,” he began in
a hard dry tone; “it seems to me about time to
speak out. I don’t know what’s come over you;
you’re clever enough, but you seem to forget that
I’m a public man. You were absolutely rude at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
reception this afternoon, and your whims are
intolerable. It’s all very annoying! If I choose
to open my house to the public I expect my
wife to accept the rôle and then to play it to the
end.”</p>

<p>Margaret looked at him. “I fail to understand
you,” she said ironically; “is this a lecture?”</p>

<p>“You may call it what you please,” he retorted
angrily, walking to and fro; “you know well
enough!”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “I’m dressing for
dinner—you’d better wait until another time,”
she remarked with a yawn.</p>

<p>“There’s no time like the present,” he said
harshly; “your manners were detestable to-day;
you treated people like dogs!”</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly. “For instance?” she
said, “Lily Osborne?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Osborne knows better than to care!”</p>

<p>“She should!” Margaret mocked, “she should
expect it; I congratulate you on her admirable
humility.”</p>

<p>He gnawed his lip, the veins swelling in his
forehead. “I warn you!” he cried fiercely, “I
will not permit such behavior—your dance at the
musicale is the talk of the town, and now you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
receive people who come here with indifference—and
I’m a Cabinet minister!”</p>

<p>“Which is a miracle!” his wife replied, laughing
softly and provokingly; “you made a mistake
in your marriage, Wicklow; you should have
chosen a more popular person.”</p>

<p>“I’m aware of my mistake!” he retorted, still
walking, and picking up first one knick-knack and
then another and setting them down again; “I
was a damned fool! I thought you witty and
fond of society; I fancied you a success and you
can be one if you choose, but everything’s upside
down with your whims. You keep Fox hanging
around here—you know that he and I are at
sword’s points in politics, you know that he—”</p>

<p>“Leave him out please!” Margaret interposed
in a cold, hard voice. She had risen and her
eyes glowed with passion.</p>

<p>White turned a lowering look on her. “Fox
didn’t marry you!” he said cuttingly, “he was
too wise!”</p>

<p>She made no reply; she could have answered
that she had given up Fox to marry him, but
the sting of the insult cut her to the quick, his
allusive familiar tone was a whiplash. She turned
away, her white face set, a singular light in her
eyes. The passion of her hatred of him at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
moment was almost beyond restraint; her very
flesh quivered under the throb of her maddened
nerves. His coarseness, his brutality, his sensuousness
revolted her; she felt, under the sting of
his lecture, a mere bondswoman, and her fetters
fairly burned into her soul. It seemed to her that
she could no longer breathe the same air with
him.</p>

<p>The child caught her sleeve timidly. “Mamma,
don’t!” she whispered, “please don’t make papa
look so—I’m afraid!”</p>

<p>Margaret looking down at her saw anew that
hateful likeness. “Go away!” she shuddered,
“you’re just like him—I can’t bear it; go, I
tell you!”</p>

<p>The child’s hand dropped and her lip quivered
with impotent anguish; she could not understand,
but she read her mother’s chilled, repellant look
and it frightened her still more; she drew her
arm across her face and fell away with a sob.
Margaret, whose heart would have been touched
at another moment, hardly heard her.</p>

<p>“I want you to understand,” White began
again, angrily, unmindful of the little girl’s presence,
“my position. I’m a—”</p>

<p>Margaret interrupted him with an impatient
gesture. “Gertrude is coming with my gown,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
she said coolly, “I think you may spare me any
more at present.”</p>

<p>White turned with a frown, and seeing the
maid at the door with her arms full of white
satin and lace, he gave way with a growl of discontent
while his wife smiled calmly at the startled
girl and bade her hurry; it was nearly eight
o’clock.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At the dinner Margaret was the most conspicuous
and observed figure at the table; she
was strikingly dressed in white satin, her lace
bodice fastened on the shoulders with jewels, her
long, slender throat wound with pearls, and the
black lace scarf—which she wore in deference
to her hostess who was dining a cardinal—only
accentuated the peculiar pallor of her face and
the whiteness of her bare arms. She was radiant,
witty, vivacious; her reckless tongue never ceased
its unmerciful chatter. She talked Spanish to the
Spanish ambassador, Italian to the Papal delegate
who sat opposite, she entertained the cardinal.
Every eye was on her; she was at once the most
unusual and the most talked of woman in Cabinet
and Diplomatic circles, and she had a wit as keen
as it was unmerciful.</p>

<p>White watched her with an increasing feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of uneasiness, he read defiance in her manner and
began to dread some overt challenge; he had been
untimely in his remonstrance, and he felt it too
late.</p>

<p>Meanwhile their hostess loved the fair offender,
and aided and abetted her in her wild sallies.
Martha O’Neal was an old, old woman, the widow
of a famous and wealthy jurist, and she was herself
famous as a hostess and a social leader. Her
eyes were still bright and keen, though her hair
was white as snow; she knew everybody, everybody
knew her; a worldly old woman who pursued
society with the eagerness of a young débutante,
played bridge for high stakes, smoked
cigarettes in an exquisite holder of gold and
amber, hurried to receptions, balls and routs
with a tottering gait and a slightly vibrating
head; a woman of large knowledge of the world,
shrewd political partisanship and, withal, an
eager and determined Romanist. Her dinners
were famous; no more than ten ever sat down at
her table, and usually five or six was the limit; she
believed in conversation, not in isolated pairs. She
had a service of gold, she would have no lights
but candles. Huge candelabra were set in niches
in her walls and on her table; her cut glass was
famous, her roses the rarest money could purchase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
yet nothing was lavish, nothing glaring or
vulgar or new. The flavor of her old wine was as
famous as the subdued taste of her surroundings;
in a season of display and a city where riches are
ostentatious, her drawing-room had the effect of
space and repose, there was no crowding of useless
and glittering furniture, no blaze of gold, no
medley of bric-à-brac and sculpture. What she
possessed represented the expenditure of a small
fortune; for the rest, her beautiful mahogany,
her rare silver were inherited.</p>

<p>The old woman, with the keen perception of
long social training, had discovered all Margaret’s
gifts as an entertainer, and her occasional outbreaks—as
the famous dance and other not less
bizarre performances—only gave her an additional
value as an element of the unexpected.
Mrs. O’Neal, therefore, rarely gave a dinner
without asking Margaret, though she included
Margaret’s husband with a grimace and a shrug. To-night
she was delighted with her guest’s gayety,
her wit, her endless vivacity, and she watched her
across the wide table with some curiosity, much
too keen not to observe the haggard misery which
Margaret tried in vain to hide. The dark, Italian
face of the delegate, the broad heaviness of White,
who wore a perturbed frown, the keen, fine lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
of the Spanish ambassador, the placid commonplace
fairness of the ambassadress, the vivid coloring
of Lily Osborne, the thin, ascetic face and
keen eyes of the cardinal were all in sharp contrast
to the pale face, the shadowy hair, the
brilliant eyes of Margaret White. Mrs. O’Neal,
watching her, wondered and was amused.</p>

<p>The dinner was a splendid affair, the delegate
talked with the smooth ease, the habitual guarded
courtesy of the Italian churchman, the ambassador
was genial and responsive, the cardinal said
little, throwing in a word now and then, but a
word which set the ball rolling, and Margaret
never failed. She had never appeared so witty,
so sweet, so dangerously amiable.</p>

<p>It was over at last, the cardinal leaving early,
and as he rose to depart, the women present being
all ardent Catholics except Margaret, rustled forward
to kneel and kiss his ring, while Mrs. O’Neal,
following the old custom abroad, had bidden her
footmen bring the candles, and the Romanists
present were gathered at the head of the stairs
to light his eminence to the door.</p>

<p>There was a little pause, and Margaret, a
slender, white-robed figure, her shoulders veiled
in a diaphanous black scarf, came forward to bid
the cardinal farewell. White, who stood apart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
uneasy and conventional in the midst of the dramatic
little scene, turned in time to see her kneel
devoutly and kiss his eminence’s ring.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They drove home early through the lighted
streets and neither spoke a word during the short
drive to their own door. The footman helped
Margaret with her wraps and attended her up
the steps; White had entered ahead of her, and
when the servants were gone and she had crossed
the hall to the stairs he called her. She turned,
with one foot on the lowest step and her hand on
the balustrade, and seeing the deep flush on his
heavy face she smiled a little with a slightly
scornful shrug.</p>

<p>He looked across at her with an expression of
savage anger, ill-suppressed. “Your conduct
passes all patience!” he said bitterly, controlling
himself with an effort; “you know where I stand,
that I want to be President, and you flaunt your
defiance!”</p>

<p>She returned his look, her head thrown back,
her eyelids drooping, the delicate hollows in her
cheeks apparent in the half light. “Pray, what
is it now?” she asked provokingly.</p>

<p>He gnawed his lip, the cords standing out again
on his forehead. “You know,” he said in a low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
voice, “you make yourself ridiculous by kissing
the cardinal’s ring! I don’t care a damn for your
religion, but I do care for the Protestant vote;
they’ll have this in the papers!”</p>

<p>She laughed a tormenting laugh. “I’m thinking of
becoming a Romanist!” she said.</p>

<p>He stared at her,—words were inadequate
but his face whitened. The slim elegance of her
figure in its splendid dress, her dusky hair, the
dazzling white of her forehead, all seemed to him
so many additional reasons to hate her. He had
bought her for these things, for her charm, her
wit, her daring, and she had turned every weapon
against him and defied him. He felt a shiver of
rage sweep through him, controlled it and turned
away at last with clenched hands.</p>

<p>She remained standing, one hand on the balustrade,
the other lightly holding her cloak which
was slipping from her bare shoulders, and her eyes
followed him with ineffable scorn and mockery.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE William Fox was plunged
deeply into the vortex of a busy session.
The holidays were over and Congress had
settled down to its task; it was the short session
year, and the bulk of the large supply bills were
being pushed steadily through the House,—the
routine of business being constantly interrupted
by the <i>fanfaronnade</i> of noisy members and the
agitation of tariff revision which hung like a
nightmare over the party in power, and was a
delightful fetich for the minority to drag out of
its hiding-place and dangle before the eyes of
their opponents. Fox, who was a leader, besides
being a great orator, was constantly employed in
holding down his followers, stamping out any
sparks of rebellion and silencing the enemy.</p>

<p>He was sharply conscious, too, of the tongues
which were busily engaged in circulating rumors
about him, for there was more than the proverbial
mustard seed of truth in the story which Mrs.
Allestree had heard. He had indeed been on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
point of entering the Cabinet, but White’s double
dealing and not his voluntary surrender had been
the cause of the exchange. There had been an
agreement between the two men who were both
from the same state; White had been allowed to
come to the Senate to serve out an unexpired term
of two years under a pledge to keep out of Fox’s
way in the matter of Cabinet changes. He had
broken his word at every point and had succeeded
in a shrewd manœuvre to prejudice the Administration
against the more clever man, no difficult
matter where jealousy of Fox already existed.
Moreover White had the inevitable prestige of
great wealth, powerful connections and an easy
conscience.</p>

<p>Fox had known many of these things when
White received his portfolio, but his later discoveries
had placed him in a position where he no
longer cared to be so frequent a guest in White’s
house; to break bread with the man who had wilfully
maligned him was an offence to his coldly
scrupulous pride. Fox was careless of public
opinion, fond of indulging his own whims and
fancies, and easy in his tolerance of offenders
against himself, but when a man transgressed the
laws that he laid down in matters of personal
honor and integrity he could be uncompromisingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
severe and contemptuous. Of late, therefore,
Fox had absented himself from White’s table
and from those evenings—famous among the
favored few who obtained invitations—when
Margaret entertained the brains and the talent
of the capital. Literary men were always there,
artists, musicians, scientists; it was said of Mrs.
White that she would entertain a famous thief if
he had wit. But there had been another and a
more potent attraction for Fox; he had found
the seclusion of Judge Temple’s library, the old
judge’s slow and studious speech, the magnificent
voice of Rose, more potent charms than the conversation
and music of Margaret’s <i>salon</i>. Having
discovered the temperamental sympathy and
ingenuous friendship in this young and beautiful
girl, Fox had begun to pursue that interesting
study of character which leads to but one result—whether
it be tragic or happy.</p>

<p>At this stage, too, of the matter, Fox ignored
the feelings and the possible claims of his less
brilliant cousin; he was aware that Allestree
loved Rose, but he considered it as an affair of
little moment because he perceived clearly that Rose
did not love him, that not even the most scrupulous
adjuration on his own part could convert her
indifference into a more tender feeling toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
painter. At first he had entertained very little
serious thought of the matter, but the charm of
Rose’s personality, both spiritual and physical,
had very soon begun to take hold of his imagination,
and if he secretly compared her fresh, sweet
immaturity with Margaret’s worldliness and finish
it was to plunge the thought instantly into
oblivion. The girl was so young, so fresh, so
easily responsive to his wit and his eloquence, that
it was like discovering a pure and beautiful flower
in a hedge of thorns. Between his work, therefore,
and his study of Rose he had managed to
refuse more than one invitation to the Whites’,
and his absence was beginning to be sharply observed.</p>

<p>There was a rumor that White had quarrelled
with him about Margaret, that Margaret had herself
openly dismissed him, that he was vexed at the
loss of the Cabinet place; in short, the usual crop
of idle ingenious stories which spring up in the
height of a winter season, like a growth of noxious
weeds, were in full bloom and strength.</p>

<p>Fox was watching the slow progress of an important
bill through the lower House, and busily
engaged at the same moment on the Naval Appropriation
Bill in which White was intimately concerned,
and which offered a wide scope for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
surmises of those who were watching the two men.
It was an open question whether Fox intended to
thwart the Secretary of the Navy or to support
his effort to get a larger appropriation. Conscious
of the scrutiny to which he was subjected,
Fox worked on, with an enigmatical smile, and
betrayed nothing of his thoughts or his position.</p>

<p>It was late one Thursday afternoon and he had
been speaking on an important matter for more
than an hour, endeavoring to close up a question
which threatened to be of international significance,
and, thoroughly fagged, he finally left
the floor of the House amid a tremendous outburst
of applause. As usual the galleries had been
packed to hear him, and he managed to make his
way out with many delays, stopped on all sides
by members and personal friends, eager to congratulate
him on another great speech.</p>

<p>Once out of the lobby, he was crossing the corridor
on his way to a committee-room when he
heard his name spoken, and turned, to see Margaret
detach herself from a party of fashionables
who had been in the Diplomatic Gallery, and come
toward him. As they met he was immediately
aware of the change in her that a few weeks of
absence had made sharply apparent. She was
extremely pale and her eyes seemed abnormally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
large and shining under the brim of her immense
picture hat, her elaborate dress only accentuating
the slightness of her figure. She held out her
hand without smiling. “I want to speak to you,”
she said, almost with an air of command, “where
can we go?”</p>

<p>He turned, hesitating a moment as to some
suitable spot, arrested by the thought that Margaret’s
presence there or anywhere, alone with
him, would be so much fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>But she solved the problem for him. “Come
outside,” she said; “it’s heavenly on the terrace,
the sun is setting. Besides, I can’t breathe here
in these corridors—heavens, where do they get
their tobacco?”</p>

<p>“Not where you buy your Egyptians,” Fox
laughed.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “The doctor says
I mustn’t smoke any more,” she said, “but I
shall.”</p>

<p>“The doctor?” Fox cast a startled glance at
her white face; “what’s the matter, Margaret?”</p>

<p>“A cigarette heart, I suppose!” she replied
laughing, and then as the smile died on her lips
an expression of dull misery fell like a veil over
her features.</p>

<p>They had crossed the Rotunda together and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
gone out by the same door where Allestree had
waited months before. As they emerged upon the
terrace they were enfolded in a radiant atmosphere,
the sun was setting, and the whole western
façade of the Capitol, the fluted columns of the
loggia before the old library rooms, the long rows
of shining windows, the magnificent arch of the
dome, were bathed in the glowing light which
seemed to flood the world. There was still a little
snow on the sheltered slopes of the terrace and
under the trees, but the promise of spring was in
the air and in the deep blue of the sky above them.
Margaret stopped abruptly and stood looking
down at the panorama at their feet; absorbed in
her own emotions, she did not immediately perceive
the expression of her companion’s face; it
was one of extreme reluctance, of reserve, almost
of resentment. He had a man’s hatred of a scene,
of being “talked about,” and he knew that such a
circumstance as their tête-à-tête at such a time
could scarcely escape unnoticed. He was annoyed
and disturbed, but for once she was blind to those
potent signs.</p>

<p>Keen as Margaret’s perceptions were, she
shared with other women the passionate blindness
to change in another when her own heart was
clamoring to be satisfied; her vision was warped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
by one aspect of it all; she remembered those
moments, long past, of comradeship and sympathy
and passion on his part; she remembered
and she refused to believe that change was even
possible.</p>

<p>The silence for a moment was almost oppressive,
then she spoke without trusting herself to
meet his eyes. “You have refused two invitations
to dinner, and you have quite deserted my evenings
and my Sundays,” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Slightly embarrassed he began some conventional
excuse, but she lifted her hand with a peremptory
little gesture. “I know—I quite understand,”
she said; “Wicklow has behaved abominably
but—am I to suffer, too?”</p>

<p>“My dear Margaret,” he replied, without too
deep emotion, “such a possibility is absurd!”</p>

<p>She looked up, searching his face, and her smile
was the shadow of itself, pale and suddenly controlled.
“You do not mean to accept his hospitality
again?” she said, with an effort.</p>

<p>He was deeply annoyed; why must she force
this issue upon him? He was capable, at times, of
extreme hardness toward others. To-day she was
unfortunate enough to jar upon him, to recall too
sharply White’s conduct. “I’m not prepared to
say,” he replied with some impatience; “can’t we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
avoid the subject? Tell me of yourself, Margaret,
you look tired and pale.”</p>

<p>She bit her lip, a sudden color refuting his
charge. “I am very well,” she replied coldly;
“I danced until two o’clock this morning; at
eleven I received a delegation of Wicklow’s jackdaws;
at two I lunched with Madame de Caillou—she
is so diplomatic that she only discusses generalities
and parrots; she has three—M. de
Caillou not included; he belongs to the poodle
class. At four I came here with Mrs. O’Neal and
Lily Osborne; I give a dinner to-night and then
go to the opera. It is much the same to-morrow.
Have you a cigarette, William?”</p>

<p>He opened his case and she selected one and lit
it; Fox was not smoking. “I presume that it
will be in the newspapers to-morrow that I was
seen with a cigarette on the terrace talking to
the next President,” she remarked dryly; “I
mean you to be the candidate,” she added, “Wicklow
is playing for it but—” she laughed, blowing
the cigarette smoke into rings before her
face.</p>

<p>“He will probably be nominated,” Fox rejoined
easily; “he has a large following; I shall like to
see you in that rôle, Margaret.”</p>

<p>“To see me?” she shrugged her shoulders;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
“my dear William, do you happen to know what
Lily Osborne is doing?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Ask me something easier!”</p>

<p>Margaret stopped in her promenade and looked
out over the city; it seemed to float in a golden
mirage, all commonplaceness, all familiarity lost
in the radiance of the western sky, against which,
here and there, a cross-crowned spire thrust its
slender, tapering height, or a campanile rose, dark
and sharply pictured, above shining roofs. Far
off the bells were ringing, sweetly and insistently,
an evening chime.</p>

<p>“She is using Wicklow to attain her ends,”
Margaret said, a little mocking smile on her pale
face; “he is dull and infatuated. I am told she’s
in Russian employ and there is information,
plenty of it, in his reach. You mark my words,
she’ll ruin him—he’ll never be a candidate.”</p>

<p>Fox frowned. “Pardon me,” he said abruptly;
“I cannot listen.”</p>

<p>She tossed her cigarette over the terrace and
watched it descend, a mere spark in the dusk below,
where evening lay in purple shadows. “Forgive
me,” she returned lightly, “I forgot—men
are such conscientious creatures and I—I’m an
unscrupulous wretch, but I’m not cruel, William!”</p>

<p>“Nor I!” he replied, with a slight change of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
color, “but, Margaret, can’t you see how impossible—”</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly. “I’m very dull,” she remarked.</p>

<p>A shuddering recognition of some new, terrible
barrier between them tore her heart. She held out
her hand. “Good-by,” she said in a low voice,
“I’m going to ask you to dine again—will you
come?” her feverishly glowing eyes fixed themselves
on his face.</p>

<p>Fox colored again, conscious that he must seem
an ill-mannered brute. “Of course I’ll come,” he
assented, vexed at himself and touched by the
sudden sweetness of her manner.</p>

<p>But her smile was wan; she felt as if the universe
moved beneath her feet; as yet the moment
was delayed when her wounded heart would refuse
to submit, and her whole passionate, sensuous
nature rise up to battle for life and love.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ROSE let the bridle lie loosely on her horse’s
neck as they halted at the elbow of the
path. Rock Creek, leaping over its gray
boulders and flowing between them with little
swirls of foam, comes rushing madly past, slips
under the trailing branches of a weeping birch
and suddenly widening, hushes its tumult and
drops placidly below the ford, where, in summer,
in a wide shallow basin, the swan and the little
white ducks lie. The scene was wild; the untouched
forest rose behind them, its bare gray
limbs against the sky, the black green of an occasional
spruce or cedar breaking the monotony
above the brown-leafed earth and closing the long
vistas of stripped tree trunks which stand on the
shoulder of the hill in serried ranks in the teeth
of the north wind, like soldiers, with their faces
to the foe. Below, the stream gurgled and murmured;
on the farther bank the dense growth of
young maples showed here and there a scarlet
bud. The air was sweet, redolent with fresh pine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and the promise of the spring; overhead the crows
were flying by twos and tens and twenties, lost at
last in the soft blue distance.</p>

<p>Fox, who was riding with Rose, dismounted and
turning back the dead leaves on a sunny slope
found a single spray of arbutus. She uttered a
little exclamation of pleasure, holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>He laughed. “When I was a boy I always
found the first wild flowers,” he said; “I knew
just where the blood-root grew and the anemone.
Since then I’ve been making speeches at the primaries
and getting votes for my party. There’s
no comparison between the two pursuits!”</p>

<p>She had the arbutus in her hand and gave him
a challenging glance; she began to understand
him better, but her convictions were too strong to
be subdued. “You mean that you’ve given up
your life for politics, just to be a part of a machine?”</p>

<p>He assented, still smiling as he remounted, and
the horses moved on at a walk.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why you think it noble to be merely
a politician,” she persisted.</p>

<p>“Am I?” his amused eyes met hers.</p>

<p>“Yes!” she retorted, “a statesman is above
his party, before it; he guides, moves, sways it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
You like to call yourself part of a machine! You
don’t vote against a bill which concerns the party—that’s
being a politician!”</p>

<p>“But I can’t betray my party,” he objected,
unmoved.</p>

<p>“You should be independent of it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t judge,” he argued, with his teasing
laugh, “your coat is of another color.”</p>

<p>“Well, at least it isn’t Joseph’s!” she exclaimed
vexed.</p>

<p>“You think I can’t be trusted?” He pursued
the subject with a boyish enjoyment of her red
cheek and kindling eye.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that—of course party men can
be honest, but I don’t call it the highest honesty to
vote against your own convictions for any party.”</p>

<p>“Yet that is what I did on a bill the other
day,” mused Fox, “because the party opposed
it.”</p>

<p>“Was it a good bill?”</p>

<p>“Excellent.”</p>

<p>“And you voted against it when you believed
in it?” indignantly.</p>

<p>“I’m the guilty creature,” he replied, laughter
in his eyes but his face sober.</p>

<p>Rose bit her lip.</p>

<p>“You see it’s a bad moment to make a split<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
in the party; next year is the Presidential campaign,”
he continued provokingly.</p>

<p>She could not restrain her indignation.
“Aren’t you ashamed to go against your own
conscience for that?” she cried; “it isn’t worthy
of you.”</p>

<p>“Then you think better things of me?” he
argued softly, “you see a chance for my redemption?”</p>

<p>She looked up and met his glance fully but
with a sudden feeling of confusion. “It is because
you are meant for so much greater things
that I speak,” she said finally; “I think you will
be a greater man than you are now at last.”</p>

<p>His manner softened at once, with that subtle
gentleness which no man knew better how to use.
“Your belief should make me so!” he said
gravely; “a man might accomplish much to
justify your belief in him!”</p>

<p>She averted her face, her lip trembling.
Around her the woodland seemed suddenly transfigured,
the tumult of the stream, breaking here
in little cataracts, scarcely leaped more wildly
than her pulses; before them the long road narrowed
in a beautiful perspective where trailing
branches locked their spectral arms and the evergreen
honeysuckle hung on gray rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Fox leaned forward in his saddle, trying to
meet her eyes, but seeing only the soft curve of
her cheek and throat. “Will you try to believe
in me?” he asked, with that new sweetness of tone
which took the sting out of his jests.</p>

<p>But she had touched her horse lightly and he
shot ahead, trotting down the long road, his rider
swaying and bending slightly to avoid an occasional
sweeping bough. Fox followed quickly, and
overtaking her, the two horses galloped together
while their riders relapsed for a while into a significant
silence.</p>

<p>“Did you know that my portrait is nearly
finished?” Rose said at last; “I think that Robert
has painted it out and in again just five
times.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t in the least like you,” retorted Fox
sharply, “he has made a failure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, every one likes it!” protested Rose.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Fox; more calmly; “I don’t—neither
does Allestree.”</p>

<p>“He has too high a standard for his work,”
she replied laughing, “but I hoped you liked
it.”</p>

<p>“No picture of you could ever please me,” he
retorted significantly; “when I shut my eyes I
can still see your face. Allestree’s wits have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
wool-gathering; he has made an image, nothing
more—he—”</p>

<p>Rose interrupted laughing. “Please don’t tell
father; he likes it, and Mrs. Vermilion was so
pleased that she and Mr. Vermilion have ordered
life-sized portraits of the entire family, <i>en masse</i>
and singly; Robert’s fortune is made.”</p>

<p>“The Vermilions are parvenus,” said Fox,
with a shrug; “poor Bob!”</p>

<p>“And why poor Bob?” she objected lightly;
“it seems to me the greatest good fortune.”</p>

<p>“Does it?” Fox looked down at the creek
musingly; “and yet I say, ‘poor Bob.’”</p>

<p>She colored, scarcely conscious of the cause of
her blush, unless Fox’s dreamy sympathy for
Allestree touched a responsive chord in her own
bosom when she remembered how lightly she had
thought of him and his unspoken but candid
devotion to her; a little thing, a word, a gesture
reproached her with ingratitude, for how easily
she had passed over all those years and forgotten
Allestree in the charm of his cousin’s presence!
Then she remembered all the stories she had heard
of Fox’s love for Margaret Ward before she married
White; steadily as she had tried to forget
them, to cease to think of his past where it touched
another woman’s life, the stories suddenly took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
tangible shape and it seemed to her that Margaret
was concerned with his existence and she—a
mere intruder. Rose, whose heart had been
hitherto as untouched as a child’s, shrank with
infinite shyness and reluctance from those old dead
leaves of passion which had never yet sullied the
whiteness of her soul.</p>

<p>Some intuition, perhaps, of her feeling warned
him, for he began to tell her stories of his boyhood
and gradually spoke of his home, his dead
mother, his father who had been a distinguished
jurist, and so, little by little, won her from her
mood. His gentleness, his kindling speech, the
tenderness of his eyes thrilled her again with that
wonderful attraction which was part of the man’s
genius and which even his enemies found incontrovertible.</p>

<p>He told her of his mother’s gentleness, her profound
religion, her meekness compared with his
father’s fierce severity, an Old Testament Christian
who beat his boys if they did not go to church
three times on Sunday and also to meeting on
Thursday nights. “And out of that home I
grew up a heathen and a publican,” he said with
a smile.</p>

<p>Rose looked steadily before her; far off the
road dwindled, and she saw Sandy racing a squirrel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
to a tree. “How can you?” she said at last,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Confess it?” He leaned forward and touched
her hand; “will you convert me?”</p>

<p>She looked up, their eyes met with the shock
of sudden feeling. Her lip trembled like a
child’s. “I’m not wise enough,” she replied simply;
“you would end by laughing at me!”</p>

<p>His face sobered. “Am I so utterly unworthy?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>She was silent; the water rushed and murmured
beside them, and the still bright atmosphere
seemed to palpitate with some great mystery;
were all barriers really disappearing and
a new sweet understanding emerging from the
challenge of their two opposing temperaments?
Her heart trembled and beat fast at the thought;
it was so wild, so improbable, so dangerously
sweet. Then she made one great effort to master
her emotions, to be herself. She schooled herself
to meet his eyes again, with that new subtle sweetness
of expression in them, that delicate understanding
of her mood which frightened her!</p>

<p>“Who am I that I should judge?” she said
tremulously, with a charming smile, full of youth,
simplicity, unconscious confession.</p>

<p>Something in the very girlishness and purity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
of her face, and her unguarded mood smote Fox
with sudden humility; he felt himself the veriest
worldling and sinner compared with her. What
right had he to thrust his life into hers? His
hand closed over hers with unconscious force.
“Who are you?” he repeated passionately, “my
guardian angel.”</p>

<p>Rose smiled; there were tears in her eyes but
his emotion had the effect of crystallizing hers,
she understood her own heart at last, and with a
woman’s intuition began to hide it; she withdrew
her hand gently and the horses went on.</p>

<p>Neither spoke; both had been deeply moved
and there was a new happiness in mere companionship.
It was one of those rare moments, in
the higher relations between man and woman,
when a new situation emerges from the old, a
more beautiful understanding is established, and
the exquisite gentleness of his mood was a revelation
to her of a phase of his character which she
had only dimly perceived.</p>

<p>The road had left the creek now and following
the rising ground lay through a growth of
stunted cedars; the stillness was broken suddenly
by the full sweet note of a robin.</p>

<p>Rose turned with kindling eyes. “Hark!” she
exclaimed softly; “doesn’t that make you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of apple-blossoms? There must be periwinkles
somewhere!”</p>

<p>The spell was broken and he smiled, turning
to look back for the singer. At the same moment
Sandy stopped and pricked his ears.</p>

<p>There was a full sound in the air, a throbbing
and buzz of some machine and a big motor-car
swung suddenly around the curve and bore down
upon them. The road was narrow and both
riders had to turn out on to the short turf beside
the cedars. The car came on, and then abruptly
slackening its speed it stopped a few yards beyond
them and some one called to them.</p>

<p>Rose looked back startled and met Margaret’s
eyes. Mrs. White was leaning on the door of the
car and beckoning to them, her great crimson hat
flaming against the dark background. Meanwhile
Louis Berkman had slipped down from the
farther side and came up to Rose smiling, hat
in hand.</p>

<p>“I feel myself as fortunate as Balaam’s ass,”
he said gayly, “since I, too, have met an angel
in the way!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Rose,” interposed Margaret
laughing; “Louis is a poet and he’s had a terrible
experience, he isn’t quite himself!”</p>

<p>“I don’t in the least mind being called an angel;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
I rather like it,” Rose retorted with amusement;
“it is only a little startling. What has happened,
Mr. Berkman?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the least importance,” he answered,
a trifle stiffly; “only Mrs. White is laughing
at me.”</p>

<p>Margaret still leaned on the door of the motor-car,
her face as white as paper against her flame-colored
hat, but her laugh was light and careless;
the fierce pain tugging at her heart demanded
a mask and she wore it gayly and well. “He
went to the White House last night,” she exclaimed
maliciously.</p>

<p>“What new form of insanity overtook you,
Berkman?” asked Fox; “went to a crush?—and
it wasn’t compulsory either!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve repented,” Berkman retorted, with
a harsh laugh; “I’ll never be taken alive again!”</p>

<p>“What happened?” Rose asked, laughing
softly, her hand on her saddle and the reins hanging
loose while the horse cropped the dry turf and
dead leaves.</p>

<p>Margaret’s laugh interrupted again. “Let me
tell them, Louis,” she said.</p>

<p>Berkman shrugged his shoulders with a gesture
of assent, coloring a little in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“He got an invitation without the cabalistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
sign,” Margaret began, her eyes dancing, “and,
in the ignorance of his soul, he went. He was an
hour and a half getting in,—you know how they
come—two and two—like the couples that left
the ark. They had to keep on the carpet; he
says one of the ushers kept shouting: ‘move on—keep
on the carpet, don’t scratch the floors!’
Louis, did you wear hobnails or sabots?”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d worn overshoes!” he retorted disgustedly;
“fancy it—I’ve been received at
Buckingham Palace and in Berlin and Vienna;
it’s the first time I was ever told ‘to keep off the
grass!’”</p>

<p>“Your own fault!” laughed Margaret, “you
should have come to me. He never got into the
Blue Room at all! Tell us what you saw in the
East Room, Louis?” she mocked.</p>

<p>“What I saw?” Berkman drew a deep breath
of indignation; “a damned lot of goats like myself;
the sheep were figuratively roped off in
sacred precincts—I saw you going to supper.”</p>

<p>“Served you right!” laughed Fox; “no sane
person goes without the open sesame—unless
forced to. What will happen when your personality
is revealed? You can trust Margaret for
that. You’ll be invited to lunch.”</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t go!” said Berkman angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Hoity-toity! you’ll have to!” cried Margaret
teasingly, “it’s in the nature of a police
summons, you know!”</p>

<p>“I’ll get out of jurisdiction! I’ll go hang myself,”
Berkman retorted, with a reluctant laugh;
and then to Rose: “I’ve just seen your portrait,
Miss Temple, and it seems Allestree has established
his fame; it is beautiful, as it should be.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you like it,” she replied; “Mr.
Fox has just been abusing it.”</p>

<p>“He’s a notorious unbeliever!” said Berkman;
“don’t mind him; it’s inspired. Mrs. Vermilion
hopes to look like it!”</p>

<p>“With the immortal bonnet?” said Fox laughing,
but with a glance which perceived every detail
of Rose’s beautiful young face and figure
radiant in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Margaret saw it; a shudder of perception
passed over her and she drew back into her corner
of the motor-car with a little sigh of agony,
dragged from her very heart, but happily unnoticed.
Her whole being rebelled against fate,
against submission, against loss!</p>

<p>Berkman was still laughing, uncovered, at
Rose’s bridle, and Fox sat listening, idly amused.
The clear atmosphere cut every detail out,—the
low growth of cedars, the sweeping slope of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
dun colored hill behind it, the dark ribbon of
woods in the hollow where the creek flowed unseen,
the long vista of the road which seemed to meet
the sky.</p>

<p>Margaret called to them. “Good-bye,” she
said, “I’m engaged to receive the <i>canaille</i>—as
Madame de Caillou calls it—at five. Come,
Louis, or else we’ll send you to the East Room
again.”</p>

<p>“The gods forbid!” he exclaimed, and ran to
the motor amid more gay laughter.</p>

<p>A moment later Margaret’s white face smiled
at them as she was whirled away.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">IX</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MARGARET leaned over the glass show-counter
in Daddy Lerwick’s curiosity-shop
and looked down at the pathetic
medley within.</p>

<p>Her figure, in its usual elaborate elegance, was
in sharp contrast to the dingy surroundings.
The fine camel’s-hair shawls hung up behind her,
the old velvet curtain with its tapestry border,
the moth-eaten furs, the tarnished Mexican sombrero,
the ancient horse-pistols, the innumerable
curious articles which heaped every corner of the
room, down to the chintz curtain, screening the
rear end of the shop in a weak-minded and fluttering
way, formed a patchwork background.</p>

<p>In the case was an ivory fan of antique workmanship
which had drifted here at last, carrying
with it a history which might frame many a tale,
and with it a tortoise-shell comb, with a top eight
inches high, some gold link cuff buttons, a string
of pearls that had clasped the throat of a beauty
in 1776, but lay now, pale and lustreless and forgotten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the price, perhaps, of a week’s lodging or
of a grave, God knows!</p>

<p>But Margaret was interested in a bracelet set
with topaz, still beautiful, still radiant, still warm
with a life’s history. She passed the stones to and
fro between her slender fingers, pricing them with
careless indifference. The romance and the sorrow
of it would have touched Rose Temple and
sent her shuddering from the purchase. To Margaret
they signified nothing but jewels and the
value of jewels, for her life of selfish ease, of social
prominence, her endless quest for pleasure, had
nearly atrophied those finer and more tender emotions
of sympathy and love for her fellow creatures.</p>

<p>Daddy Lerwick himself waited on her. He was
a short, thickset man with the face of an underdone
pudding, his gray whiskers attached like
wings below the ears. His small dull eyes seemed
to observe little, but he was notorious for driving
a shrewd bargain and nothing really escaped
him.</p>

<p>“The stones are good stones,” he commented,
clasping his fat creased hands on the case in an
attitude which displayed the solitaire on his little
finger, “and the price very low, madam.”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed, her eyes haggard again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
“You get them second-hand,” she observed carelessly;
“who brought these?”</p>

<p>He looked at her without surprise and unclasped
his hands. “I have the name,” he said;
“the law requires that we take the name, but I
don’t think they ever give the right one, and we
don’t tell it—usually. It was a young girl,
madam, quite a young girl.”</p>

<p>“Never mind!” Margaret dropped the chain,
her mood changing. “I really didn’t want to
know,” she said with a shrug, “why should I?
I don’t know why I asked. I’ll take the gold
cigarette-case, if you can get the monogram off,
and the tea-pot. Bring them over and I’ll send
the check.”</p>

<p>The man bowed and rubbed his hands. He
knew Margaret very well and profited largely by
her careless and profuse use of money. Knowing
the world too, as he did, and the people in it, he
thought her more wretched than the girl who had
traded the bracelet, or the owner of the gold
cigarette-case who, he happened to know, had
since shot himself and now lay in an unmarked
grave. Daddy Lerwick, indeed, knew more than
was good for him but, perhaps, not more than
many others who stand thus at the gateway between
the upper stratum of gilded pleasure and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the lower stratum of sordid misery, and receive
the tolls!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unconscious of his eyes and certainly
proudly disdainful of his thoughts, the society
beauty, the Cabinet minister’s wife, trailed
through the dingy shop and passed out by the
side door, which Lerwick opened for her, to the
stairs of Allestree’s studio. As she ascended, the
cloud which had rested on her face slightly cleared
and her expression grew more decisive; the desolate
misery of her heart had taken a more concrete
form, she had arrived at last at a resolution.
She had reached a point where she must resist or
die. Her bruised heart throbbed with continuous
pain and she was proudly aware that she was
losing all—losing it, too, without an apparent
struggle. She, Margaret, who had always borne
herself proudly and defiantly to the world, was
she to be a mendicant asking the alms of love and
asking it in vain?</p>

<p>She swept on, crossed the landing under Aunt
Hannah’s accustomed window, and thrusting aside
the portière entered upon a tableau of the artist and
his two new clients, Mrs. and Miss Vermilion, and
her enemy, Mrs. Wingfield. The two older women
stout, tightly laced, gorgeously over-dressed, the
younger, slender and well done by the best French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
art and with that indescribable air of disdain
which, commonly assumed by the parvenu to be
the sign manual of birth and breeding, might be
called the bar sinister of society. At the sight
of Margaret, however, she unbent with an alacrity
which was as amazing as it was sudden.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. White,” she chirped, “do come
and advise me; mamma wants me painted, and
really I can’t choose a pose! I saw a picture of
the Duchess of Leinster which was lovely, but Mr.
Allestree says he never copies even attitudes!
Isn’t it confusing?”</p>

<p>Margaret shrugged one shoulder and held out
two fingers to the elder women. “Try Aphrodite
rising from the sea,” she suggested with a provoking
drawl, “I dare say Bobby can do waves,
he’s admirable on flesh tints.”</p>

<p>The girl colored furiously and bit her lip. It
was impossible to know where to meet Mrs. White,
she reflected, without daring to provoke another
catastrophe by retaliation.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wingfield had felt the sting of Margaret’s
rudeness too often. She moved to the
door with the rustle of silk draperies. “I hear
Mr. Fox is to marry Miss Temple,” she said
pointedly, looking Margaret full in the face.</p>

<p>“And I heard that Mr. Wingfield was to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the mission to Brazil,” retorted Margaret unmoved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingfield’s cheek crimsoned and the
feathers on her bonnet trembled. “Nothing of
the sort! You don’t mean to tell me you heard
that?”</p>

<p>Margaret shrugged her shoulders again.
“One hears everything, you know!” she said,
with a dangerous smile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingfield breathed hard and opened her
lips, but Mrs. Vermilion was a wiser if a duller
woman; she laid a restraining hand on her arm
and propelled her gently but firmly toward the
exit.</p>

<p>“You’re coming to my ball next week, Mrs.
White?” she ventured with a propitiating smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it next week?” drawled Margaret,
with elevated brows, “I never know. Little Miss
English keeps my books; if she didn’t I should go
to the wrong place every night and forget the
White House.”</p>

<p>“I thought your memory more accommodating,”
Mrs. Wingfield retaliated pointedly; “I
remember when you forgot to come to my dinner
after you’d accepted.”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. “Did I?” she said, “I’m
evidently a sinner. Tell Mr. Wingfield that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
heard who wrote in those corrections in that paragraph
of the message—but I really can’t tell.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingfield turned away with a red cheek.</p>

<p>“Margaret!” remonstrated Allestree sharply,
as the three women withdrew, “how can you?
Good Lord, talk about the brutality of men!
Women are Malays and North American Indians—you
have no mercy! I’m blushing all over now
at the thought of it!”</p>

<p>She laughed, her short, even white teeth set
close together, her eyes sparkling. “Wasn’t I
horrid?” she said, “I haven’t any manners and
they hate me.”</p>

<p>“I should think they would!” he replied
warmly, “Margaret, why do you do such things?
It isn’t like you, it isn’t—”</p>

<p>“Well bred!” she concluded dryly, “I know
it. The other night, too, I did something that
horrified Wicklow. We were dining at Mrs.
O’Neal’s; I knelt, and kissed the cardinal’s ring.
Wicklow was wild; he seemed to have an A. P. A.
nightmare at once. It was all in the New York
papers yesterday,” Margaret laughed again, resting
her arms on the back of the carved chair where
Rose had sat.</p>

<p>Allestree laid down his brushes; he had been
working on a sketch of Margaret herself, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
lighting a cigarette, he passed his case to her.
She took one mechanically and lit it at his. As
the spark flamed up between them, he caught the
hollowness of her eyes, the startling pallor of her
face.</p>

<p>“What in the world is it, Margaret?” he
asked sharply; “you’re ill.”</p>

<p>She turned and looked over her shoulder into
the mirror. “Do I look so?” Something she saw
in her own image, in the deeply shadowed eyes,
the sharpened curve of the cheeks startled her.
“What a fright I grow to be! No wonder that
Vermilion girl stared. What an Aphrodite she’d
make—in French corsets and a trail!” Margaret
laughed silently.</p>

<p>Then catching a look on Allestree’s face which
she read too easily. “Were you born proper,
Bobby?” she said, knocking the ashes from her
cigarette, “or did you achieve it, or was it thrust
upon you?”</p>

<p>“I can’t paint you in this mood, Margaret,”
he said dryly, “you wouldn’t look like yourself;
you’d remind me of a malicious elf.”</p>

<p>She leaned her elbow on the chair back again,
resting her chin in the hollow of her hand.
“There!” she said, “I told William Fox that
you’d make me the imp to Rose’s angel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“I’d like to make you what you are, a fascinating,
wilful woman with no heart at all!” he
retorted.</p>

<p>“No heart!” she laughed, tossing her cigarette
away; “that’s true, Bobby, I’ve no heart!”</p>

<p>As she spoke she moved over to Rose’s portrait
which still rested on an easel in the corner. It
was a magnificent piece of work, the artist had
dreamed his heart into it; the young head symbolized
youth, purity, hope. The figure had the
simplicity and loveliness of some beautiful Greek
inspiration when the art of Greece was young.
Margaret stood looking at it in silence, herself
unaware of the sharp contrast between the pictured
youth and enthusiasm of this girl and her
own slim beauty, her subtly charming and unhappy
face, which seemed to have lost that magic
touch which is like a breath from the Elysian
fields, the presence of belief, of hope, most of all
of love. She turned at last and met Allestree’s
thoughtful glance. “Bobby,” she said briefly,
“you’re a fool.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “What else, oh, mine enemy?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Everything;” Margaret threw out both
hands with a gesture which seemed to appeal to
earth and heaven; “a blind fool, Bobby! You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
love her, she probably loves you, and yet you
stand by and let her go! Fool, fool!” Margaret
drew her brows down, her cheeks flaming:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘He either fears his fate too much,</div>
<div class="verse">Or his deserts are small,</div>
<div class="verse">Who fears to put it to the touch,</div>
<div class="verse">To win or lose it all!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>she quoted defiantly.</p>

<p>Allestree lighted another cigarette. “My dear
Margaret,” he said, “let me show you this sketch
of my mother.”</p>

<p>Margaret bit her lip and stood watching as he
turned over two or three sketches. As he did so
her quick eye caught familiar outlines. “So, that
is Lily Osborne?” she said, with a hard little
laugh; “I’m not sensitive, Bobby, let me see it.
Did you know the latest gossip about her?”</p>

<p>Allestree shook his head. “Spare me!” he
said smiling.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, you deserve no quarter!”
Margaret took the sketch and looked at it, ignoring
the one of Mrs. Allestree; “it’s good,” she
commented with amusement; “how fine and full
blooded she looks, and reptilian. The gossip is
that she’s caused the recall of the Russian Ambassador;
she’s been telling tales out of school,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the female diplomatist, you know! What did you
do, by the way, when she met Rose here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we got on,” said Allestree laughing;
“what of it?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard?” Margaret laughed;
“Rose went there to one of madame’s small and
earlies; you know the kind? It seems they played
bridge and Rose didn’t understand it was for
money; imagine a lamb in the hands of wolves!
Poor little simpleton! Well, Lily told her at last
that she owed two hundred. Rose fled home, and
the judge—” Margaret laughed and shrugged
her shoulders. “Old Testament Christian, you
know! He sent the check but he told Rose to cut
her dead.”</p>

<p>“I knew there was something; Rose never told
me, but they speak,” he rejoined, “the way you
women do! In spite of your shrugs, Margaret,
you know the ethics of the thing were abominable;
it’s swindling.”</p>

<p>Margaret continued to laugh. “My dear
Bobby,” she said, “Rose isn’t sixteen and we all
play bridge; I lost six hundred last night; she
should have known. It’s tiresome to be a madonna
on a pillar!”</p>

<p>“Still Rose was right,” he said bluntly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Oh, granted!” Margaret touched his arm
lightly; “and you love her!”</p>

<p>Allestree made an impatient movement.
“Don’t torture me, Margaret!” he said sharply.</p>

<p>She whirled around and held out both hands,
her eyes moist. “I’m a brute, Bobby!” she cried;
“forgive me—I always say the wrong thing unless
some one sets me a copy; let’s talk about
Mahomet’s coffin!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH Margaret things had reached a
crisis long before that culminating moment
of remorseful emotion in Allestree’s
studio; at last the realities of life—as
they appear separated from its pleasures and its
follies—were forced upon her. Too young at
the time of her marriage to comprehend its full
significance, as a mere act of barter and exchange,
she had never seriously anticipated her position
as White’s wife; it had been shrouded in a nebulous
haze of gratified vanity, of pleasures and indulgences,
for she was glad to shirk the thought
of it. Her awakening, therefore, had been accompanied
with a shock of horror and disgust.</p>

<p>White had been kind to her at first; even the
most common and violent of brute creatures is
often kind to its chosen mate, and he was proud of
her beauty, determined to get the value of his
money out of her social distinction; but her
capricious temper, her bitter tongue and her indifference
soon had their natural effect. His kindness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
wore itself out and when angry he could be
tolerably brutal, for his temper, at best, was coarse
and exacting. She had come at last to look upon
the beautiful house, the lavish display, the sumptuous
living as so much gilded misery, and, possessing
no talisman to give her contentment, her
stormy nature spent itself in rebellion and in
a growing regret for her own folly. She saw, at
last, in Fox all the qualities which she most admired;
her mind answered his with a subtilty, a
kindred sympathy which seemed to assure her of
his love, to justify her assumption that his feeling
had never changed. In her eager pursuit of
happiness she had thought to purchase it first
with beauty, then with money and now with
love—the beggar’s price! It was the absorbing
impulse of her being; religion she had none, except
the religion of self-indulgence. Standing on the
brink of disaster she still demanded happiness; it
was her creed, her gospel, her divine right. The
temptation of it, too, pursued her; how easy to
obtain a divorce from Wicklow, a word almost and
it was done! It was true that there would be a
great scandal but, after all, the scandal could only
add a zest to her social success; she was young,
beautiful, distinguished, and if she broke the
shackles that bound her could she not begin all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
over again? Intoxicating dream,—how full of
temptation it was, of alluring sweetness! After
all, does not the devil appear to us in the shape
of an angel of light?</p>

<p>What were ethics compared with her inalienable
right to be happy? The thought of it made
her draw a keen breath of relief. Free!—She
alone knew the value of that word.</p>

<p>The children crossed her mind only occasionally;
Estelle was more and more like her father
every day, and as for the baby? Margaret had
only vague conceptions of his possibilities; she
had seen but little of him since his birth, except
in his nurse’s arms, but she had recognized that
odious likeness to the Whites. Of course old Mrs.
White would take them; she adored them, and
Margaret felt that she knew more about them
than she did. After a while when they grew up—but
Margaret could not afford to dwell upon
it. They were associated with her misery, her
captivity, as she chose to call it, and she could
not love them; she shrank, indeed, from the
thought of them, and the responsibility that their
existence had thrust upon her, as so many links
in her chains.</p>

<p>She returned from her interview with Allestree
in a curious frame of mind. Her unreasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
discourtesy to the Vermilions and Mrs. Wingfield—people
who really only hovered on the edge of
her horizon—her insistent attacks upon Allestree’s
sore heart, had all been prompted by her
own feverish misery. Once alone in her room she
went to the mirror, and holding up one of the
candelabra, gazed long and fixedly at her own
reflection, asking over again the question she had
asked herself on the night of Mrs. O’Neal’s dinner.
Had she lost her beauty? Was the potency of her
spell destroyed in some mysterious way? Hideous
thought—was she growing old?</p>

<p>She saw, indeed, all that she had seen in Allestree’s
mirror, and more; the misery that looked
out of her own eyes frightened her, and there were
more delicate lines than there had been on that
previous occasion, or else the light was stronger.
This was the reason then of the senseless stare of
Miss Vermilion’s china blue eyes—Margaret
wondered vaguely why girls of that sort always
had china blue eyes?</p>

<p>She set down the candelabrum, and sinking
into a chair by the open fire began to brood over
her troubles, forgetful that she must be dressed
soon for her own reception; it was the night
when her weekly guests assembled at those already
famous evenings. Her thoughts reverted to Fox;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the remembrance of his love for her was like the
sudden fragrance of violets in a desolate place.</p>

<p>He had loved her; it never seemed possible for
a moment that a word, a sign, could not reanimate
his passion, as a breath of air will strike
fire from the smouldering embers. Now, too, she
could appreciate and understand his love; she was
no longer a raw slip of a girl or a stiff little
Puritan like Rose Temple! But she knew the
barrier which existed between them; never by a
word or a sign had Fox trespassed against
White’s hospitality, he would never urge her to
desert her husband, but if she were free—</p>

<p>She rose and began to walk about the room,
touching first one object and then another with
restless fingers; the thought of freedom was like
wine, it went to her brain; the vision of the
divorce court, the lawyers, the judges, the newspapers,
floated into space. She stretched her
clasped hands high above her head and drew a
long breath, her soul almost shouted for joy.
Freedom!</p>

<p>It was, next to happiness, the desired of the
gods! And after all did not one involve the
other, was not one absolutely essential to the
other?</p>

<p>She wondered, with a smile, why they talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
so much cant about marriage and divorce? Had
they suffered as she had suffered they would
rejoice, as she did, at the thought that there
were divorces, that one could be free again!</p>

<p>Free—good heavens! Not to see him every
day, not to hear his voice, with that mean, trivial
rasp in it, not to be one of his chattels!</p>

<p>And Rose? Margaret did not allow herself to
dwell too long upon that vision of the girl’s
young figure, her fair, animated face against the
background of the cedars and the sky. Was
she jealous of her? That was an ignominy too
deep to contemplate without bitter self-abasement;
she refused to believe it! The shuddering certainty
which had drained the life-blood from lip
and cheek became now, on reflection, a fancy of
her feverish brain. Such a raw, simple creature
as Rose was no mate for William Fox; that indisputable
attraction of opposites, which is one of
the laws of nature, for a moment lost its significance
in her eyes; she would not believe it. It
was not quite natural for her, though, to take
this view, even for a moment, for a woman, as
a rule, has less faith in the endurance of a man’s
love than he has in it himself, because she has
usually discovered that the heart of the ordinary
male creature is uncommonly like a pigeon-cote!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>She was determined to forget all these things;
she walked to and fro battling with herself, her
restless hands sometimes at her throat and sometimes
clasped behind her head. The strong passion
of rebellion which shook her being amazed even
herself. She would never give him up! She could
not—to Rose or to any one; her starved heart
cried out against surrender and defeat, he was
hers—<i>hers</i>.</p>

<p>Her maid’s knock at the door startled her, she
stopped short and passed her hands over her
eyes, her face burned; she no longer lacked color,
her cheeks had the flush of fever. The girl,
coming in to dress her, was surprised by her high
colored beauty, the brilliance of her eyes, and
began to lay out the gown and its accessories
with nervous fingers, half expecting one of Margaret’s
wild bursts of temper. But her mistress
seemed only concerned with her toilet; one gown
after another was tried on and rejected until at
last she was arrayed in a shimmering dress of
violet and silver which was as delicate as the
tints of the sky at moonrise. She allowed no
ornament on her white neck and arms except a
single diamond star which clasped the ribbon
around her throat.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more perfect than her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
manner to her guests. It was one of those occasions,
growing constantly more rare, when White
had no reason to complain. She was charming
to all, from the most distinguished to the most
socially obscure, she forgot her prejudices, she
even forgot to snub her husband’s political protégés—to
their infinite and undisguised relief—and
to her own particular coterie she was the
old, charming, inimitable Margaret. As on the
occasion of her musicale, men predominated, and
among those men were all the notables at the
capital. Speaking several languages, Margaret
had made her house a Mecca for all Europeans;
it was an open secret that she espoused the cause
of the Russian ambassador against his secret
enemy, Lily Osborne, and espoused it with a zeal
which caused a whispered sensation in official circles.
It was an anxious question what Mrs.
White might not dare to do, for it was believed
that she would pause at nothing in her determination
to defeat Mrs. Osborne. Yet it was never
hinted that she concerned herself even remotely
with White’s devotion to the fair <i>divorcée</i>. Her
indifference to her husband was a fact too generally
accepted to cause even a ripple in the
stream.</p>

<p>There had been much secret comment on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
changed and haggard looks, but her dryadlike
loveliness to-night silenced every whisper, and her
gayety, her ease, her clever, reckless talk proclaimed
her the same Margaret they had always
known and loved and feared, whose wit was as
keen as it was cruel.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Neal was the first to bid her good-night.
The old lady in her gorgeous panoply
of silk and velvet tottered on, like an ancient
war-horse answering the bugle call, her white
head vibrating as she talked. Still athirst for
social power and success, no one was a keener
judge of achievements, and she patted Margaret’s
hand.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she whispered, “you’re the most
charming creature in the world when you choose!
I’m old enough to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I can never equal you,” Margaret retorted
lightly, “even when I choose!”</p>

<p>“There! It was worth the risk to get the
compliment!” the older woman laughed back;
“and your husband, he looked most distinguished
to-night, and those dear children—I saw them
in the park! Be good, my child, and you’ll be
happy!” and she smiled complacently at the
axiom as she moved away, a figure of ancient
gayety in tight shoes and costly stays. An hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
later when her maid had taken her to pieces,
she presented a spectacle at once instructive and
amazing.</p>

<p>Following Mrs. O’Neal’s exit, the accepted
signal for departure, Margaret’s guests began to
flow past her in a steady stream, stopping a
moment for the individual farewells or congratulations
on the pleasures of a brilliant evening. She
was standing just inside the ballroom door alone,
for White had been summoned unexpectedly to
the White House a half-hour previously, his departure
adding to the zest of gossip and speculation
upon the political situation. Margaret’s slim
figure in its shimmering dress, her animated face,
the peculiar charm of her smile, had never been
more observed; she was beautiful. Those who had
questioned it, those who had been only half convinced
and those who had denied it, were alike
overwhelmed with its manifestation. It seemed as
if the intangibility of her much disputed charm
had vanished and her beauty had taken a visible
shape, was crystallized and purified by some
fervent emotion which made her spirit illuminate
it as the light shines through an alabaster
lamp.</p>

<p>One by one they pressed her hand and passed
on, feeling the inspiration of her glance; one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
white haired diplomat bent gracefully and kissed
her fingers, an involuntary tribute which brought
a faint blush to her cheek.</p>

<p>Fox was among the last to approach, and as
he did so she stopped him with a slight but
imperative gesture. “Stay a moment, William,”
she murmured, with almost a look of appeal, “I
want to speak to you.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished he turned back, conscious
that by so doing he startled a glance of comprehension
in the eyes of Louis Berkman, who was
following him, which annoyed him for Margaret’s
sake. He went over to the fireplace and stood
watching the falling embers while the remaining
guests made their adieux, then as the rustle and
murmur of their departure grew more distant
and lost itself in the rooms beyond, he turned
and saw her coming down the long room alone
and was startled by the extreme youthfulness and
fragility of her appearance, and by the discovery,
which came to him with the shock of surprise, that
her radiant aspect had slipped from her with her
departing guests, that her face was colorless and
pinched, though her eyes were still feverishly
bright.</p>

<p>“It was good of you to stay,” she said, coming
to the fire and holding out her hands to the blaze;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
“how cold it is for the first of April. Sit down,
William, and let me send for wine and cigarettes;
you look tired.”</p>

<p>He raised a deprecating hand. “No more
hospitality,” he said firmly; “you’ve done
enough; you’ve lost all your color now.”</p>

<p>“Except what I put on with a brush,” she
said dryly, clasping her hands and letting her
long white arms hang down before her as she
looked across at him with a keen glance. “I
know—you’ve eaten nothing here since Wicklow
broke his word and the rest of it. You won’t
eat his bread!”</p>

<p>Fox colored. “Should I be here in that case?”
he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head, glancing at the fire.
“You can’t fool me—I understand.”</p>

<p>“Come, I must go,” he said firmly; “it is very
late and you look wearied to death. You must
be, you were absolutely the life of it to-night;
you should have heard old de Caillou rhapsodize!”</p>

<p>“Did I do well—did I look my best?” she
asked, her lip quivering like a child’s, her eyes
still on the fire.</p>

<p>“You were your own happy self!” he replied.</p>

<p>She looked up, her slight figure swaying a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
little as she wrung her hands together; the tears
rained down her cheeks. “Billy,” she sobbed,
“I’m wretched—I—I can’t stand it any
longer, it will kill me!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOX stood aghast at the force, the agony,
the abandon of Margaret’s confession.
Any presentiment which might have
warned him had been disarmed by her previous
gayety.</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously his hand met hers, which
was stretched out in a mute appeal. He drew her
to a chair. “Sit down,” he said, in an unsteady
voice, with an impotent impulse of resistance;
“try to calm yourself! This is dreadful!”</p>

<p>She obeyed him mechanically; sinking into the
great armchair and turning her face against it,
she continued to weep, her whole delicate frame
shaken and quivering with her emotion.</p>

<p>Fox stood still holding her hand and looking
down at her in deep perplexity. He was intuitively
aware of the extreme peril and delicacy of the
situation for them both, only too certain of her
wild and unguarded impulses, and that moment—more
supremely than ever—revealed to him
the absolute demise of his own passion. He tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
to quiet her, speaking a few gentle and soothing
words, sharply conscious of their inadequacy.</p>

<p>But she scarcely heeded them. After a moment
the storm spent itself, and she turned, revealing
her white, tear-stained face which was still beautiful
in spite of her weeping. “There comes a
time,” she said, in a low voice, “when one can
bear it no longer—when one would rather die.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Margaret, don’t say such
things!” he exclaimed, profoundly moved.</p>

<p>Her lips quivered. “Is it so dreadful to say
them?” she retorted passionately; “when you
feel them? When they are burned into your
flesh? I’m so weary of conventionalities. I tell
you that I can’t bear it, that I will not bear it
any longer!”</p>

<p>As she spoke she rose and stood facing him,
her eyes feverishly bright and moist with unshed
tears. “You ask too much of me, you have no
right to ask it—no one has!” she continued, her
lip quivering again; “I cannot be silent—it’s
killing me by inches!”</p>

<p>Fox colored deeply; he was suddenly forced
into an impossible position. “My dear Margaret,”
he said gravely, “I have no words to
meet it; you must know how profoundly I feel
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“If I did not—if I were not sure of you!”
she replied, a little wildly, “it would kill me
sooner. Sometimes I have wanted to die. The
doctors say that I have heart trouble—I hope
I have! If I believed in prayer I should have
prayed to die.”</p>

<p>“Margaret! is it as bad as that?” he cried,
in sudden uncontrollable pity; he remembered
her as so young, so beautiful, so happy!</p>

<p>Her lips twitched. “As bad as that?” she
repeated wildly; “I feel like a trapped squirrel,
a rabbit in a snare, I can only shriek because it
hurts me—it isn’t bad enough yet to kill! I’m
caged—oh, William, William, help me get
out!”</p>

<p>“Margaret!” he exclaimed sharply, “don’t
you know that I can’t hear this? This is White’s
house, I’ve broken his bread. My God, how
dreadful it all is!”</p>

<p>Her hand clenched unconsciously at her side,
her white neck rose and fell with her tortured
breathing, a horrible doubt had assailed her.
Then the light broke over her face; he loved her,
that was it, and he was too honorable to speak!
She held out both hands. “William, forgive me,”
she murmured softly, “but what have we gained
by silence? What does it all matter to the world?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
But you must go, perhaps I did wrong to tell you
now! Good-night, I—I—”</p>

<p>Her lips quivered pitifully. “I have always
loved you—don’t think me a wicked woman.”</p>

<p>“Margaret!” he groaned, deeply, terribly
touched, yet with a sickening consciousness of his
own unresponsive heart.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, moving away from him
toward the stairs. “Oh, you must go, good-night!”
she repeated, as he paused half reluctant.
“I’m resolved, nothing shall change me—in a
little while—” she paused and he saw the change
in her face, its lighting up and softening, the
revelation of its beauty, its subtle charm; saw
it with a slow agony of remorse and reluctance;
“in a little while,” she said, and her smile was wonderful,
“I shall be free!”</p>

<p>Fox scarcely knew how he got out of the house;
he left it in a dream and went directly home to
his own apartments in an uptown flat. The distance
was not great and he scarcely allowed himself
to think. His mind was almost confused
by the sudden and blinding climax. But as he
opened his door, and the dog, Sandy, leaped to
meet him, a rush of feeling swept away his passive
resistance; he forced himself to turn on the lights
more fully and to look about at the familiar objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
which met his eyes on all sides, his books,
his pictures, his littered writing-table; he even
picked up the evening mail, which his clerk had
left in its accustomed place, and looked over the
pile of letters and pamphlets. But it cost him an
effort.</p>

<p>It was very late, but sleep was impossible, and
picking up his hat and stick he whistled to Sandy
and the two went out into the almost deserted
streets. The dog leaped about him with quick,
joyous barks, rejoicing in the unexpected outing,
and Fox turned his face northward, walking
steadily along the brilliantly lighted and
strangely quiet avenue which led him through the
heart of the northwest section and up on the hill.
The tumult of his mind found relief in the physical
exercise and the fresh cold air of an early April
night.</p>

<p>In spite of that central egotism of his, which
was capable of much when unkindly stirred, Fox
believed that he possessed strong convictions on
the nicer points of honor. If he had drifted often
to White’s house and been much in Margaret’s
society it was with no intention of offending
against his host. His indolence, his carelessness
of what was mere gossip and tittle-tattle, had
made him indifferent to the conclusions of others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
but he was not unaware of the talk and the surmises
of his enemies; he was not unaware that
Margaret stood on delicate ground and that, if
she separated from White, there would be a wild
burst of excited comment—the comment which
costs a woman her good name. Such being the
case she had suddenly thrown herself upon his
sympathy, she had torn away the thin veil of conventionality
which had saved them, and it was for
him to desert her or to defend her when the
supreme moment came.</p>

<p>That moment would involve not only his own
happiness but—he paused in his thoughts with a
shock of feeling which flooded his consciousness
with a lucidity, an insight, which appalled him.
Was he mistaken, or did it also involve the happiness
of the young and innocent girl whom he
loved? At the thought of Rose his heart sank;
he felt instinctively her abhorrence, her complete
lack of understanding of his peculiar situation.
To Rose’s mind, doubtless, he would appear in the
likeness of Mephistopheles!</p>

<p>Good God, what would she think of him? he
thought; but yesterday he had held her hand,
looked into her pure, young eyes, almost spoken
the final words which would have laid bare his
very soul—and now! He seemed to feel the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
heated, perfumed atmosphere, the pressure of
Margaret’s fingers on his arm, her wild, sweet
smile when she proclaimed her love for him without
shame—how vividly he saw it! And her
absolute belief in his unchanged love for her!
Infatuation, madness, self-deception, it might be
all these and more, but she was a woman—and
she had flung herself upon his mercy!</p>

<p>As yet that other aspect of the affair, the
blighting of his public career which such a
scandal might in a measure effect, had not thrust
itself upon him; his only thought was for Rose.
In that hour he learned how profoundly he loved
her; it was part of his nature that the very denial
of a gift increased his desire to obtain it.</p>

<p>He walked long and far; the night was lightly
clouded; but once the moon broke through a rift
and flooded the upper sky with light. As he
turned on the heights the city lay at his feet,
dark and slumbering save for the lighted streets.
A policeman tramping past glanced keenly at
him. The air had a crispness that was not wintry,
and once or twice the sweetness of hyacinths
reached him from some flower-studded lawn.
Sandy trailed at his heels, faithful but anxious;
the way was new and the hour strange.</p>

<p>They walked on; it was toward morning when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the man and the dog returned and, when they
entered his rooms again, Fox’s face was white,
his eyes and mouth were haggard, with the look of
a man who has passed through a great crisis with
much agony of soul. For he had found but one
solution, and that sealed his lips.</p>

<p>If his careless preference for her, for her gayety
and her wit, if his thoughtless seeking of her
society, if the coupling of his name with hers, had
led her to this breaking of her life, then there was
no question, there could be no question—he
thrust the thought deep down out of sight but it
remained there, coiled like the serpent, ready to
strike at the heart of his happiness.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XII</h3>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was ten o’clock in the morning, and Rose
was clipping the dead leaves from her flowers
in the bow-window of the library, while Judge
Temple still read the morning paper in his great
high-backed chair; a shaft of sunlight stealing
through the open carving touched his scanty white
hair and showed the crumpled lines of the blue
veins on his temples. He was an old man; he had
married late in life and Rose, the youngest born
and only survivor of five children, was proportionately
dear to him. There was a warm sympathy
between them and a companionship beautiful
to see.</p>

<p>“There’s some trouble in the Cabinet,” he observed,
as he turned his paper; “there are hints
here about Wicklow White.”</p>

<p>Rose looked thoughtful but continued to arrange
her flowers. “Margaret seems very unhappy
and very gay, as usual,” she remarked
softly.</p>

<p>“Too gay, my dear,” the judge commented;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
“old-fashioned fogies like myself get easily
shocked. Never go to her dressmaker!”</p>

<p>Rose laughed, her scissors sparkling in the
sun. “Why, father, people rave about her and
copy her everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Let them,” said the judge dryly, “let them—but
not my daughter! Rose, I’d—I’d whip
you!”</p>

<p>“You never did that in your life,” she smiled,
“I’m almost tempted to try it and see.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” he retorted grimly, taking off
his spectacles and putting them into his pocket;
“you’d get a lesson!”</p>

<p>“Poor Margaret!” Rose colored a little; she
had caught the glance which Margaret had bestowed
on her and Fox.</p>

<p>“Poor fiddlesticks!” replied the judge, rising
and folding his paper; “she’s made her bed, child,
and she must lie on it; that’s the law of life; we
reap as we sow.”</p>

<p>Rose looked across at him affectionately, but
she was wondering what he thought of William
Fox; she had never dared to ask. “It’s a hard
law, father,” she said gently, “we all want to be
happy.”</p>

<p>“You will be—just in proportion to your
right to be,” he retorted calmly; “it’s a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
of the heart anyway, Rose, and not of external
matters.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” she replied, with a slight sigh;
“but one would like to have externals and internals
agree, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>The old man laughed pleasantly. “Most of us
would,” he admitted, “but we never have our way
in this world, not in my observation.”</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a stir in the hall, and a
young girl appeared at the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>“It’s Gertrude English,” Rose said; “don’t go
yet, father, I’ll take her away.”</p>

<p>But it appeared that the judge had to go to
court, and he went out, patting little Miss English
on the shoulder as he passed. “We children
grow,” he said laughing.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d grown more,” she retorted ruefully;
“everybody calls me ‘a little thing,’ and I’m not,
really, I’m five feet four.”</p>

<p>“Napoleon was small,” remarked the judge
teasingly, “and William Third and Louis Fourteenth.”</p>

<p>“I know what you think of two of those!” objected
Gertrude; “we remember our history lessons
here, don’t we, Rose?”</p>

<p>“Well—but when a rogue’s famous!” said
the judge, and went out smiling at his own jest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Miss English walked over to the window and
watched Rose water her plants and turn them
religiously to the sun.</p>

<p>“Take off your hat, Gertrude,” she said pleasantly;
“you really look tired; can’t you stay
awhile?”</p>

<p>Gertrude shook her head. “No,” she said
firmly; “I’ve got about a million notes to write
for Margaret and the lunch cards to get ready
for to-morrow; to-night she dines the President.
I’m tired of it; I wish I could make money cracking
stones!”</p>

<p>“Poor Gerty!” Rose looked at her with gentle
concern; “you’re very pale, you look as if you
hadn’t slept.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” said Miss English flatly, “not a
wink.”</p>

<p>“I hope Margaret doesn’t make you work
late,” Rose murmured, beginning to search again
for dead leaves.</p>

<p>“Margaret?” the little secretary sat down and
leaned her elbows on her knees, her chin in her
hands; “Rose, I’m so sorry for her!”</p>

<p>“She seems gay enough,” Rose observed quietly.</p>

<p>“I should say so! I was there very late last
night; it was one of her entertainments, and little
Ward was sick. I sat with him. You know she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
treats the children sometimes like playthings, and
again—like rats! I was in the nursery watching
him and helping the nurse until all the guests
went. Then I went down stairs; I wanted to tell
Margaret what I’d done, and I went to the ballroom
door. She didn’t hear me call to her, and I
went back up stairs feeling like a sneak. She was
there with Mr. Fox and she was crying dreadfully
when I saw her.”</p>

<p>Rose’s scissors clipped sharply and a fresh
young twig fell unnoticed to the floor. There
was a long pause. Miss English had mechanically
taken off her gloves and she was drawing them
through her fingers, her face full of honest
trouble.</p>

<p>“After awhile she came up stairs,” she continued,
“and came into the room where I was—”</p>

<p>“Gertrude,” interrupted Rose suddenly,
“ought you to tell me this?”</p>

<p>“Every one will know soon,” said Gertrude
dryly; “she came over and looked at the child
and said she was glad he was better—he was
asleep then and the nurse had gone out of the
room for some extra milk. Margaret’s face was
white, and her eyes—I never saw her eyes so
wonderful. Suddenly she flung her arms around
my neck and began to cry, softly so as not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
wake the child. She told me—she’s going to get
a divorce!”</p>

<p>Rose put aside her scissors and sat down, looking
across at Gertrude with a strange expression,
but she said nothing.</p>

<p>Miss English sighed, folding her gloves again.
“Of course I know how bad it’s been,” she said;
“he’s a brute to her sometimes and swears at her
before everybody but, well, Rose, don’t you think
you’d swear at Margaret if you had to live with
her?”</p>

<p>Rose smiled a little, her lips pale. “I don’t
know, Gerty,” she said, “I never did—in my
life.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?” Miss English sighed again;
“well,” she said, “when you’re poor, downright,
disgustingly poor, you just have to say ‘damn’
once in awhile, if you didn’t you’d kill somebody!”</p>

<p>“But White isn’t poor,” objected Rose, “he’s
only vulgar.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course there’s Lily Osborne,” Gertrude
shrugged her shoulders; “there won’t be
any trouble about the divorce in the State of New
York or anywhere else, I fancy! I wonder if she
means to go to Omaha.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe it’s really settled?” Rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
asked, with a strong feeling of self-abasement;
she thought herself a scandal-monger, an unworthy
creature, but her heart quaked within her
with an unspoken dread, and Miss English’s next
remarks drove it home.</p>

<p>“Without doubt,” she said; “I know it is
and,”—she colored a little and looked out of the
window at the April sunshine on the garden wall—“Rose,
do you believe she’ll marry William
Fox?” she whispered.</p>

<p>Rose sat regarding her and said nothing.
What could she say, poor child? That vividly
pictured scene of Margaret weeping and Fox as
her comforter was burning deep, and Rose had
been brought up by an Old Testament Christian!</p>

<p>“It would be a great pity,” Miss English observed,
after a long silence; “it would ruin Mr.
Fox—people would say <i>everything</i>.”</p>

<p>Rose colored painfully. “People say very cruel
things, Gerty,” she said slowly, “and, perhaps,
we’re as bad as any just now.”</p>

<p>Gertrude shook her head vigorously, her pleasant
round face flushing a little too. “I don’t
mean to be,” she said, “of course it’s a great
temptation; we secretaries know everything, it’s
like turning a dress inside out and finding the
lining’s only paper-cambric with a silk facing;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
it’s all a big sham, we’re on the inside and know!
But, goodness, it would ruin Fox, and I know,
Rose, I know she’s in love with him.”</p>

<p>Rose looked steadily away; she, too, saw the
ivy leaves fluttering gently in the sunshine as the
light breeze rippled across them.</p>

<p>Miss English sighed. “Well,” she said, “I
don’t care; Margaret’s so unhappy, it seems as
if she ought to try over again, only there are the
children. I forgot though, Rose, you’re very
stiff-necked; I suppose you hate divorces?”</p>

<p>Rose shook her head. “I don’t believe in marriage
after divorce,” she said; she was very young
and she had rigid standards, like a great many
people who have never had to test them in their
hearts’ blood.</p>

<p>Gertrude English opened her mild blue eyes.
“Don’t you?” she said, “I didn’t, either, until
I saw Margaret; then I began to think it was
awful to have to live out a mistake; and there’s
White too; really he’s had his trials. I don’t
know whether it would be wicked or not for her
to marry again.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Scriptural,” said Rose firmly, her face
colorless now.</p>

<p>Miss English rose and began to put on her
gloves. “Well, there isn’t any marrying or giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
in marriage in heaven,” she remarked, “so I
suppose most of us have got to do it all here. As
far as I’m concerned, I don’t find any rush for a
poor girl. It’s amazing to me that the male creatures
can’t see the advantages of the habit of
economy!” she added, with a good humored
laugh.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d stay to lunch,” said Rose mechanically;
she had not Gerty’s keen sense of
humor, and her heart felt like lead in her bosom.</p>

<p>“I can’t!” the little secretary went to the
mirror and adjusted her hat-pins; “I’ve got to
go and write notes. Margaret has no head, and
she’s probably in bed now. You know she really
has heart trouble; I shouldn’t wonder if she died
in one of her fandangoes.”</p>

<p>“And she’s talking of divorce and marriage!”
Rose looked gravely into the other girl’s troubled
face.</p>

<p>“Of course; isn’t it like her?” Miss English
moved slowly to the door, buttoning her gloves,
and Rose followed.</p>

<p>In the hall she turned. “After all, who’s to
blame?” she said stoutly; “Margaret’s awfully unhappy,
and Fox—goodness, he used to almost live
there, he was there to everything until that row
with White over the Cabinet business. I’d like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
know what you think of him, Miss Moralist, a
man who flirts with a married woman!”</p>

<p>“I try not to think of it,” Rose replied quietly.</p>

<p>Miss English had opened the door and the sunlight
streamed in. “Oh, good gracious!” she
exclaimed; “why, Rose, what’s the matter?
You’re as white as a sheet!”</p>

<p>“I’ve—I’ve got a headache,” Rose faltered,
the fib lodging in her throat, for she had been
reared to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth.</p>

<p>“And I’ve been teasing you! I’m a brute. Go
and lie down, you poor dear!” Gertrude kissed
her affectionately and penitently; “try phospho-caffein;
your hands are like ice!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing—only a headache,” fibbed
Rose, more easily the second time; she realized
it with a shudder. The way of the transgressor
is not always hard, the road is wide, also it is
agreeable—but she had not discovered that yet!</p>

<p>“I’ll stop by to-night and inquire,” said Gertrude.</p>

<p>But Rose shivered at the thought of continued
deception. “Oh, I’ll be all right,” she called after
her visitor, then she closed the door and laid her
head against it; everything turned dark for a
minute and swam around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>She went back to the library and picking up
her scissors put them away, and quite mechanically
arranged her father’s chair and his footrest and
looked up the book he would want in the evening.
She tried not to let her mind dwell too much on
what Miss English had told her, but her lips
tightened and her eyes darkened with controlled
emotion. She had led, hitherto, a happy, sheltered
life, she had never suffered much, and her
capacity for suffering was very great. Her character,
which was just emerging from the malleable
sweetness of girlhood, had begun to feel the impress
of her father’s stern morality. With Rose
right was right, and wrong was wrong; there was
no middle course. She had an exalted conception
of duty and the sacrifices that one should be ready
to make for a principle. She had never tested
any of these admirable theories in the fiery furnace
of temptation, but she had a shadowy notion
that if she had lived in the age of Nero she should
have offered her body to be burned to save her
soul alive. It is unfortunate for some of the
modern Christian martyrs that they did not live
at that time; a diet of prepared breakfast foods
and French entrées is not conducive to the production
of heroes.</p>

<p>Rose had been so happy the day before, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
birth of a new and beautiful emotion had so
transfigured her young soul, that this sudden and
dreadful revelation was in the nature of a thunderbolt
from a clear sky; her heart shrivelled and
shrank within her. Yet to question Fox, to doubt
him was, to her simple, loyal nature a hideous
possibility.</p>

<p>If this were true, if he had all the while loved
a married woman—</p>

<p>Rose knelt down by her father’s vacant chair
and laid her head on her arms. She tried to thrust
the thought away, but it haunted her and that
verse—she had been brought up on the Scriptures,
she knew them by heart, their denunciations
had frightened her when she was a little
girl, they chilled her still—<i>For whosoever shall
keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point,
he is guilty of all.</i> She shuddered; what should
she do? O God, would it be very hard? She
caught herself pleading; was she begging off?
The stern conscience in her made her start up
from her knees with a sob.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT fell out—most unseasonably for the Vermilions—that
Mrs. O’Neal had planned her
annual reception for the same night as their
fancy-ball. All the world was sure to go to Mrs.
O’Neal’s sooner or later, and it broke up the mask-ball
at an unusual hour, just before the champagne
began to take effect, which was, on the
whole, rather a mercy to the Vermilions, though
they knew it not and suffered some keen pangs
of anger and jealousy. Mrs. O’Neal had, of
course, done it on purpose, Cynthia Vermilion
said, and, perhaps she had! Mrs. O’Neal was a
thoroughly worldly old person who would have
driven her social chariot over a hundred Vermilions,
figuratively speaking, and felt a grim pleasure
in doing it. The world is not precisely the
place for the cultivation of the more tender feelings,
or an undue love for your neighbor, and
Martha O’Neal had long since forgotten that
there might be really serious reasons for considering
any one but herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>So she gave her famous annual ball on that
beautiful spring evening when the scent of the
lilacs in her garden came in through the open
windows. She had the house decorated with
Easter lilies—it was Eastertide—and she had
made her offering from the front pew in the most
fashionable church in town, wearing her new bonnet
while her head vibrated sufficiently to make
the roses dance in weird mockery on its brim.
She had remembered to mention, too, that she
gave a thousand dollars a year to the church,
because it is quite useless to hide your light under
a bushel. Having done all these things she gave
her ball on the Vermilions’ evening, and it was a
very beautiful, a very select and a very famous
affair, made more famous in the end by an incident
which she had not foreseen.</p>

<p>Those poor Vermilions! They had spent many
thousands, and yet people hurried away or came
late, only to eat the supper; old Vermilion was
a magnificent provider. Of course there were
some who never went to the Vermilion’s at all, but
always to Mrs. O’Neal’s; among these were the
Temples and old Mrs. Allestree, who made a point
to be present at Martha’s house, for she and Martha
had been schoolmates and were still good
friends, although nothing could have been more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
amusing than the contrast; the one in her old-fashioned
dress with her placid face and her
kindly smile, and the other, tight-laced, over-burdened
with satin and jewels, her old head wagging
and quivering under its high white pompadour
and its jewelled <i>aigrette</i>.</p>

<p>Her rooms were thronged; the dark polished
floors, the old mahogany furniture, the glittering
mirrors, the bewildering array of candles, tall
candles and short candles, huge seven-armed silver
candelabra, short, stout silver candlesticks,
the masses of white lilies, the sweet, heavy odor
of them; what a beautiful, dazzling, fanciful
scene it was, when the lovely women in their rich
dresses began to throng every room and corridor
and even lingered laughing and talking on the
wide stairs and in the gallery above which commanded
the lower hall and the ballroom, where the
fluted pillars were festooned with vines and
crowned with capitals of roses. The old, old
woman, with her white head and her false teeth
and her gorgeous gown, receiving her guests, chattering
and smiling and proud; truly the ruling
passion is strong in death. She stood there nobly,
heroically, cheerfully, though her tight satin shoes
pinched her poor, old feet, and the draughts from
the door sent a shiver of rheumatic pain across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
her poor, old, bare, shrivelled shoulders; and the
wide expanse of her ample neck and bosom, clad
in jewels and the imagination, felt the breeze
too.</p>

<p>After awhile the guests from the fancy-ball
began to drift in, a few at first in costume, and
then more and more, until the ballroom took on
the look of a harlequin show, and there was much
gay laughter and criticism of each new arrival
from those who had disdained the Vermilion ball
or who had never been asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne came, beautiful and striking,
dressed as an Eastern sorceress, and almost at
once she had a circle around her in the corner
of the conservatory, and was telling fortunes and
interpreting dreams with all the arts of a charlatan
and the charm of a lovely woman. The
crimson tunic, the dark blue petticoat worked
with gold, the shapely ankles with broad gold
bracelets, the glittering scarfs which draped her
shoulders and revealed her white arms, the dull
gold band on her forehead, binding back the
masses of glossy auburn hair, all combined to
make her a charming and seductive picture. She
told fortunes well; it is an alluring art, it shows
pretty hands and delicate wrists, and the downward
sweep of soft eyelashes, the arch of a white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
brow, besides that swift glance upward from bewilderingly
lovely eyes—</p>

<p>The women looked at her over their shoulders
and stiffened, while the men all had their fortunes
told and found the lines on their palms of sudden
and absorbing interest. One or two elderly
women, the mothers of grown boys and girls, were
seized with a sudden desire to go home, but it was
no easy matter because the elderly gentlemen belonging
to them, and also the fathers of grown
boys and girls, found that corner too attractive
to leave.</p>

<p>Judge Temple, observing it with his shrewd
common sense, smiled with much secret amusement
and looked about to see if Rose saw it, for Rose
would understand though she had not his sense of
humor. But he discovered Rose greeting William
Fox with an expression on her sweet young
face which startled him. She was smiling and
speaking easily, he saw that, but what was it in
her eyes, her lips, which seemed almost too subtle
to interpret? The judge stopped talking to his
nearest neighbor and looked at his own child
oddly; could it be? Then he looked at Fox and
there he read something too, the look of a man
in pain, physical or mental, a pain which he meant
to hide. The old judge had been to the supper-table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> 
and was standing at the door when he saw
them; he quite forgot the plate in his hand, he
almost let a strawberry roll off on to the floor when
he heard Mrs. Allestree’s voice.</p>

<p>“Dear me, judge, do remember that I’m wearing
my one evening gown and strawberries stain!”
and she laughed as she saw his start; “there, see
what it is to be a philosopher out for an evening
with a frivolous old woman!”</p>

<p>“My dear Jane,” replied the judge—he had
gone to school with Mrs. Allestree—; “I’d forgotten
that it wasn’t a strawberry vine. Do you
remember those we stole from old Mr. White’s
patch a thousand years ago?”</p>

<p>“Do I?” the old woman sighed; “Stephen,”
she said, “how much nicer they were than these!
I wonder if I stole some now—”</p>

<p>“I should send you to jail,” he retorted, twinkling,
“the second offense, you know!”</p>

<p>“You stole those yourself!” she replied indignantly,
“I was only accessory after the fact!
Who in the world is that?” she added, catching
her breath and craning her neck to peep through
the throng.</p>

<p>It was Margaret White. She had just come
from the fancy-ball where it had been her whim
to appear as Ophelia. Perhaps her conscience had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
pinched her for her treatment of Mrs. Vermilion
in Allestree’s studio, or it had merely pleased her
to go. It was often impossible to find the key to
her conduct. At any rate she had gone, and she
came late to Mrs. O’Neal’s, where she was to meet
her husband, for he had refused to go in costume
to the Vermilions’. He was a man of too heavy
common sense to trick himself out in fancy dress,
and on that one point he knew his own limitations;
he had never been able to play a part to his own
satisfaction, and he had too high an opinion of
Wicklow White to belittle him with a failure. So it
happened that he had already had his fortune told
by the enchantress in the conservatory when a ripple
of excitement from the ballroom reached him.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Allestree spoke the crowd had
parted to let Margaret pass through it. She
wore a flowing, soft, white gown, thin, clinging,
revealing her neck and arms and the long slim
lines of her figure; her hair, which was beautiful
and an unusual tint of pale brown, was unbound
and hanging, trimmed with flowers, while her arms
were full of them.</p>

<p>There was a silence; every eye was on her, and
there was an instantaneous recognition of her
remarkable fitness for the part; the delicate,
subtle beauty of her face, her brilliant eyes, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the dusky shadows below them, the longing, the
pain, the uninterpreted feeling of her expression,
her wild hair, her slim, graceful figure, the appealing
beauty of her slender white hands as she
held them out, offering rosemary and rue and
daisies, was she really an actress born or—the
very nymph herself? That mystic atmosphere of
tragedy which sometimes seemed to pervade her
being had at last found an expression at once
visible and beautiful.</p>

<p>It was her whim to play the part out, and people
watched her, fascinated; those who did not
approve of her, those who disliked her, as well as
those who fell under her spell, watched her with
undisguised eagerness. She drew all eyes and
knew it. She looked up and saw her husband
standing in the door of the conservatory; their
eyes met with a challenge; they had quarrelled
woefully over her coming in this dress, and it only
needed the sight of him to kindle her wilful daring,
her abominable obstinacy. Some one called
her by name and spoke to her but, unheeding, she
began to sing Ophelia’s song, throwing flowers as
she walked slowly, very slowly down the crowded
room.</p>

<p>“Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny!” she
sang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>There was a little breathless applause, but she
met it with a vacant look, coming on, tossing a
rose here, a lily there, to be caught by some ready
hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingfield, unhappily, stood in her path.
She had been watching her approach with an
expression which needed no explanation, but she
could not be content with silent disapproval, she
rushed upon her fate. “Why, how do you do,
Mrs. White,” she said, in her audible voice, “I
really didn’t know it was you; I thought it must
be some actress!”</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her blankly, then she put
her head on one side. “‘Well, God ’ild you!’”
she exclaimed, “‘they say the owl was a baker’s
daughter.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingfield turned painfully scarlet.
There was a titter, an audible and wavering
titter around her. Alack, there were only too
many who remembered, with the memory of society,
that her father had dealt in loaves and
fishes!</p>

<p>But Margaret had passed on; she handed a
flower to Fox as she passed, rosemary for remembrance;
she gave a rose to Rose Temple and to
the judge a sprig of rue with a little malicious
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Call it herb of grace o’ Sundays!” she said
lightly, and the judge laughed good humoredly
with the others, for he knew that his stiff, old-fashioned
manners and customs were often meat
for jests.</p>

<p>After all, it was not so bad, people were obviously
entertained; White began to draw a breath
of relief, he tried to signal to her to stop. But
Margaret was not done, instead, the very spirit
of defiance seemed to possess her. She suddenly
knelt in the centre of the room and began to make
a wreath of flowers, singing Ophelia’s lament, her
sweet, high voice carrying far in the great rooms.
The throng of gayly dressed women drew farther
away, the circle widened, necks were craned,
those behind stood on tip-toe.</p>

<p>It was too much for Wicklow White, he could
endure no more; he walked abruptly across the
space. “Margaret,” he said, in a low peremptory
voice, “this is too much, we must go home!”</p>

<p>She looked up and shook back her soft, wild
hair as she tossed a flower at him.</p>

<p>“‘For bonny, sweet Robin is all my joy!’”
she sang maliciously.</p>

<p>He crimsoned and bit his lip. Again some one
applauded; there was a slight murmur of talk.</p>

<p>Margaret rose abruptly from her knees and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
began to laugh, herself again, gay, debonair, indifferent.
“What a fool I can be to entertain
you,” she said, her delicate face bright as a child’s.</p>

<p>People gathered about her at once; she was
congratulated, praised, but in the corners others
disapproved and thought her a little mad. Mrs.
Osborne glanced meaningly at her nearest friend
and tapped her forehead, and Mrs. Wingfield
laughed furiously.</p>

<p>“What a delightful side-show!” she said;
“they say White will lose his place—no wonder!”</p>

<p>The throng had closed up again, the gay murmur
of talk rose; the musicians were just beginning
to play a waltz and the ballroom was filling
with dancers.</p>

<p>Margaret, laughing and talking gayly, stood
in the door. Fox, looking across at her, experienced
a feeling of deep amazement. What an
actress a woman can be! It seemed to him that
he had dreamed that scene in White’s house, that
it was impossible, untrue, a phantasm of his troubled
brain. Then, as he watched her, pondering
on a woman’s unfathomable moods, he saw a sudden
gray whiteness spread over her face like a
veil, her eyelids quivered, her lips parted and she
swayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>In an instant he had reached her and caught
her as she fell. Judge Temple helped him hush
the stir it made, and he carried her quietly and
swiftly down stairs to a reception room below
where he could get help at once.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Half an hour later Judge Temple took Rose
home.</p>

<p>“What was it, father?” she asked, as they
got into the carriage; “I didn’t see it and I just
heard that Margaret fainted. Mrs. O’Neal kept
us all dancing, she didn’t want it known.”</p>

<p>The judge looked thoughtfully out of the window.
He was not thinking of Margaret. “She
is better now, they got her home in a little while.
I believe White did his best in spite of that scene,”
he said; “she has heart disease; the doctor intimated
to me that she might go just like that if
she keeps this up—but people live a long time
with Margaret’s kind of heart trouble; I knew
one man who had it for twenty years and finally
died of stale cucumbers. A beautiful creature, a
very beautiful creature, I’ll admit it!”</p>

<p>Rose made an effort, she must learn to hide her
heart, she who had never hidden anything!
“Father, may I go to her dressmaker?” she asked
archly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“No!” he said sharply, “nor walk in her ways—the
most extraordinary creature! Jane Allestree
tells me there’ll be a divorce, and no wonder!”</p>

<p>Rose was silent for a moment. “Yes,” she said,
“Gerty said so.”</p>

<p>The judge leaned back in his corner and passed
his hand over his eyes. “Ah!” he ejaculated
and relapsed into silence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ROSE slept but little that night; she tossed
instead, trying to still her heart. She had
seen Fox but a moment in the throng, but
that moment had been enough for her to feel the
subtle change in their relations. Her perceptions
were delicate, far reaching, exquisitely sensitive.
He was not himself, his troubled eye met hers with a
confession of sorrow which she could not interpret.
Standing outside of his consciousness, unaware of
the struggle in his soul, she only saw estrangement,
awkwardness, a mute appeal, which seemed
to her incapable of explanation unless he loved
Margaret and had been trifling with her. The
thought made Rose sit up in bed with flaming
cheeks.</p>

<p>It is useless to inculcate the spirit of meekness
and Christian submission in a child when you cannot
pluck the old Adam out of the heart. Rose
was her father’s daughter; she meant to be a
good Christian, she had little stiff limitations in
her life, but she never thought of breaking her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
pride; it came to her with her blood, with her long
and respectable descent from a race of God-fearing
English yeomen, transplanted to the soil of
a new world and endowed with a new and fuller
stream of blood and physical beauty, but with
the same hardy pluck, the same psalm-singing,
fighting spirit which led the van at Naseby.</p>

<p>If Fox loved Margaret, if he meant to marry
White’s wife when she was free—Rose shuddered,
she had learned her father’s views on divorce and
re-marriage by heart. At least, he should not
pity her!</p>

<p>After awhile she lay down again and hid her
burning face on her pillows, for it was wet with
tears. She would not cry out, she would not
flinch, but it hurt.</p>

<p>In the morning she bathed her eyes again and
again in cold water, dressed and went down to
breakfast. The judge was reading his morning
paper and they were both rather taciturn. The
old man had troubles of his own just then which
Rose knew nothing about. He had invested some
money unwisely and had heavily endorsed the notes
of a friend, a man he had trusted, but lately a
doubt began to thrust itself into his abstracted
mind. Besides his salary as judge he had but a
slender fortune, and if that were really involved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and he should die—he looked up over his paper
at Rose with anxious, affectionate eyes. She was
looking down at her cup of coffee and did not perceive
his glance, but he saw again the trouble in
her face and thought her eyes looked as if she had
been weeping; there was a droop, too, to her lips
which was unnatural. It set him thinking, and a
cloud settled on his usually serene brow.</p>

<p>After awhile he got up and went into his
library to finish his paper before he went out, and
he was still there when Rose came in and began to
tend her plants. He noticed that she was very
quiet and that she took less pains than usual. He
laid down his paper. “Rose, has Allestree finished
your picture yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” she replied, blushing suddenly;
“but he keeps on fussing over it. Perhaps
we should send for it.”</p>

<p>“I want to pay for it; I’ll send him a check
to-day,” the judge said, opening a drawer and
looking absently for his checkbook; “it may not
be convenient later.”</p>

<p>Rose set down her pitcher and stood twisting
a broken leaf in her fingers. “He’ll never take
anything for it, father.”</p>

<p>The judge looked over his spectacles. “We
can’t take such a present,” he remarked dryly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
“I’m afraid you’ve let Robert fall in love with
you, Rose.”</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, pained glance. “I—I
hope not!” she said softly.</p>

<p>The old man smiled. “He’s a good boy, Rose;
I shouldn’t disapprove except that I can’t spare
you—I’m such a selfish old brute.”</p>

<p>“And I can’t leave you!” she retorted with
a queer little laugh, tears in her voice; “but I
know Robert won’t take any money for it; I—I
shouldn’t dare offer it.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t, but I shall,” replied her father
calmly; “if he tells me he’s in love with you I
shall not be surprised; no one will be any the
worse for it, Rose.”</p>

<p>“I should be very sorry,” she said simply.</p>

<p>The old man gave her a keen glance and pursed
his lips as he wrote the check.</p>

<p>“He’ll never take it,” she repeated, taking up
her pitcher again.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not anxious to give him you instead!”
said the judge.</p>

<p>Rose laughed a little in spite of herself. “You
need not!” she replied.</p>

<p>Her father signed the check. “Rose,” he said,
in an absent voice, “what did Gerty English say
about Margaret’s divorce?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Rose bent assiduously to her task. “Not
much,” she answered quietly; “just that it was
settled, she meant to get one; she’s very unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Of course she means to marry again, that’s
what they do these days,” the judge said, in a
tone of fine irony; “one husband isn’t enough or
one wife. Solomon ought to get here! Of course
she’ll marry Fox.”</p>

<p>Rose was silent; through the open window she
could see the buds on the Persian lilac, but she
shivered.</p>

<p>“What I should like to know,” said the judge
shrewdly, “is this—<i>does Fox want to marry
her</i>?”</p>

<p>Rose put her hand to her throat with a helplessly
futile gesture. “They say he was in love
with her long ago, father.”</p>

<p>The old man smiled. “My dear child,” he remarked,
“women always remember that Jacob
served seven years! But Fox is a genius, an unusual
man and probably as fickle as the wind.
However, he’ll have to reap as he has sown; doubtless
he has dangled at Margaret’s elbow; it’s been
the fashion. Well, well, it will very likely thwart
his career and, if so, he’ll deserve it, but I hoped
great things of him though I’ve feared him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
little too; genius is like fire—it burns where it
touches.”</p>

<p>He rose and put aside his papers. “I’ve written
to Robert and enclosed the check,” he said;
“he’ll get it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go there to-day,” said Rose; “I
shouldn’t dare to-morrow; he’ll be furious.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, he has too much sense,” retorted
the judge; “besides, he can’t have my girl
yet!”</p>

<p>“Nor ever!” said Rose smiling as her father
bent suddenly and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Ever is a long word,” he replied and laughed
gently; in his heart he believed that Allestree
would make her happy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An hour later Rose joined Mrs. Allestree on the
way to the studio. The old lady was out walking
in the spring sunshine, her fine aged face mapped
close with delicate wrinkles and little puckers and
her keen old eyes bright and alert in spite of the
weight of years.</p>

<p>She took Rose’s proffered arm with a smile. “I
forgot my cane,” she said; “I always forget that
I’m more than twenty-four until I try to go up stairs.
I tell Robert that I can’t climb up to his
studio much longer, he’ll have to have an elevator.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
I’m going now to see your picture, he means to
send it to your father to-morrow; it’s been hard
to part with it!”</p>

<p>Rose colored deeply, much to her own chagrin.
“Father is anxious to have it,” she said, “he
spoke about it this morning.”</p>

<p>“Wants to pay for it, I presume,” the old
woman retorted shrewdly; “I’ve always said that
Stephen Temple would offer to pay for his halo!
Tell him not to try to pay Robert, Rose, it would
hurt.”</p>

<p>Rose looked at her helplessly. “He’s written
about it,” she said reluctantly; “I told him, but
he would do it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree’s sensitive face colored almost as
vividly as the girl’s and she stopped, her hand on
Rose’s arm, and looked down thoughtfully. “It’s
in your father’s writing, of course?” she said at
last.</p>

<p>“Yes, he wrote this morning and posted it himself.”</p>

<p>The old woman drew a long breath. “I’m going
to commit a felony, Rose,” she said, “I’m going
to get that letter; Robert’s mail comes to the
house, I see it first. I shall send the check back
to your father myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’ll be angry,” said Rose thoughtfully;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
“I didn’t know what to do; I was sure
Robert didn’t want to—to be paid for it.”</p>

<p>“Paid for it!” Mrs. Allestree shook her head
sadly; “my dear child, it has been a labor of
love. You couldn’t ask Robert to take money for
it.”</p>

<p>Rose was silent, she felt herself a mere puppet
in Mrs. Allestree’s hands; the old woman was as
shrewd and as skilful as the most worldly matchmaker
in her gentle and affectionate way; besides
she adored her son and, like most mothers, she was
willing to offer up any sacrifice which seemed to
her sufficiently worthy for immolation. There was
a moment of embarrassment on Rose’s part, and
she was glad to see the Wicklow White motor-car
coming swiftly toward them. At the sight of the
liveries Mrs. Allestree turned quickly and caught
an indistinct view of a woman’s figure, a white
chiffon hat and a feather boa.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Margaret!” she exclaimed, half
stopping to look back.</p>

<p>“No, it’s Mrs. Osborne,” Rose said quietly;
“she’s taken off her half mourning.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree’s face changed sharply. “In
White’s motor-car?” the old woman glanced
after the vanishing juggernaut with an eloquent
expression. “Society is curious now-a-days!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
White has behaved outrageously; I suppose
you’ve heard of the divorce project?”</p>

<p>Rose nodded. “Gerty told me.”</p>

<p>“So she did me,” said Mrs. Allestree grimly,
“in strict confidence, of course!”</p>

<p>They looked at each other and laughed helplessly.</p>

<p>“Poor Gerty, she tells everything!” said Rose;
“but she’s so good hearted.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” remarked Mrs. Allestree,
“the longer you live the more convinced you’ll
be that good-hearted people and fools are blood
relations. Of course White has behaved dreadfully,
we all know it—but the Lord knows Margaret
has provoked him beyond endurance many
a time! I shall speak to her about the children.
Robert says I sha’n’t; he’ll have me locked up
first, that it’s none of my business. A pretty way
to speak to his old mother! I can’t help it, I shall
ask her to remember her poor little children.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they’re an awful burden to her,
anyway,” rejoined Rose soberly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll admit that it’s an affliction, a downright
scourging of the Almighty’s, to have them
look so much like old Mrs. White! But she’s got
to consider them; she brought them into the
world, poor, little, homely souls! Estelle always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
reminds me of a little pink-eyed rabbit! As for
the divorce, it will be a hideous scandal!” and the
old lady’s bright eyes glanced quickly at Rose.
She was wondering if she had heard that Mrs.
Wingfield said that Fox was the cause of it. It
was cruel, it couldn’t possibly be true, but it was
sure to gain credence and Mrs. Wingfield knew it!</p>

<p>William Fox was her own nephew, she was
proud of him and she loved him, but she was torn
between her desire to see her son happy and to
shield her nephew. Her thin old lips opened once
to speak and closed again quickly; no, she dared
not! What was in the child’s heart? Rose was
such a child and her father had brought her up
so unlike other girls, she was sure to take the
man’s view, the hard, flat, ethical view of Stephen
Temple, and Mrs. Allestree felt, with some secret
amusement, that she would as soon try to argue
with the devil as with the judge when once his feet
were planted in the straight and narrow path, the
old, blue Presbyterian path, as the old woman
called it, with her whimsical smile.</p>

<p>Ah, if Rose had only loved Robert as any well
regulated young woman would! But Robert’s
mother had few self deceptions on that point; she
had eyes and she had used them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they walked up the hill to the studio.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
On the right, the terraced wall of the corner
garden was half hidden by the fresh green sprays
on the ivy which mantled it, and a great purple
lilac in full bloom nodded above it, its fragrance
filling the air. The row of old brick houses opposite
had assumed a more genial aspect, here and
there a striped awning broke the dull red of their
monotonous fronts, and the white pillars of a
rejuvenated portico shone in the sunshine. A
little girl was buckling her roller-skates on the
curb just in front of Daddy Lerwick’s curiosity-shop.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree stopped and halted Rose before
the glass show-windows, peering in at the odds
and ends with a smiling face. “Rose,” she said
amusedly, “what shall I give you? A camel’s-hair
shawl or a six shooter?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t buy anything here,” the girl replied
quickly; “I suppose I’m foolish, but the
thought—oh, poor things, how it must have hurt
to sell them, one after another, for a trifle, too!”</p>

<p>The old woman laughed softly. “You’re your
father’s daughter, Rose,” she said; “I’m
ashamed, but I’m going to buy that old mirror.
Go up stairs and send Robert down with his
purse; I don’t want you about, you make me
uncomfortable!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“I suppose I am very silly,” Rose admitted reluctantly,
“but I can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you’re perfectly right, I haven’t a
doubt about it,” laughed Mrs. Allestree gently;
“you haven’t a sense of humor, that’s all, child,
and if I were a man I’d just as soon marry an
animated conscience; you’ll either reform your
husband or you’ll be the death of him! Now, go
and send Robert, for I’m an old sinner and I want
that mirror!”</p>

<p>Rose went up stairs, laughing in spite of herself.
But as she approached the studio she caught
her breath, she heard voices, could Fox be there?
She hesitated and stood still, agitated by the
thought, then, unwilling to listen even to assure
herself, she parted the portières and called to
Allestree. As she did so she came face to face with
Mrs. Osborne. This then was her destination
when she had passed in the motor-car, Rose
thought swiftly, but it was too late now to retreat;
she gave Robert his mother’s message.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” he said, “if you’ll excuse me a moment,
and bring mother up; if I don’t, she’ll get
the whole shop on credit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go at once!” exclaimed Mrs. Osborne
laughing; “that would be worse and more expensive
than a bridge tournament.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Rose bit her lip; the reference was pointed and
she caught Robert’s eye full of doubt. “Go,” she
said hastily, “and bring your mother up stairs;
she didn’t want me there to see her bargain.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be a moment,” he exclaimed, and they
heard him running down stairs.</p>

<p>Left alone with Mrs. Osborne, Rose moved to
the window and looked out. The atmosphere was
radiant; even the commonplace narrow street below
was touched with the alchemy of spring; sunshine
slanted across it, a flock of pigeons gathered
where some grain had fallen, to rise with the whir
of wings at the first alarm. The garden opposite,
above the terrace wall, was coming into bloom, a
tall magnolia in a fluttering mantle of white and
pink and the lilacs full out on the southern slope,
while behind it, a long row of young elm trees
were still delicate with new greens, and beyond
rose the gray tower of the church across the
square. How sweet it was, how calm, how reassuring!</p>

<p>Rose heard the rustle of the other woman’s
silken linings as she moved restlessly about the
studio, and after a moment she came over to the
window, though Rose’s very attitude was repellent.</p>

<p>“How full the lilacs are,” she observed, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
girl noticed the rich softness of her tone, “I like
them; we had lilacs about the old house at home.”</p>

<p>“They grow wonderfully in New England, I
know. I’ve often seen them like trees,” Rose rejoined
a little stiffly.</p>

<p>“But I’m not from New England,” laughed
Lily Osborne, “I’ve often wondered what mother
thought of it.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t a New Englander then?” Rose
turned and looked at her, more interested than
usual.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne shrugged her shoulders with
much expression. “She was from New Orleans,
a French Creole. She married a Frenchman, I
was born in Paris; it was my husband who took
me to New Hampshire first; my mother had lived
there five years with some relatives, but she never
spoke of it!” she added laughing.</p>

<p>“You are only half an American then,” Rose
remarked, surprised.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne looked at her critically through
her long eyelashes. “I’m a woman,” she said;
“that’s all we ever are, my dear, and it’s enough.”</p>

<p>“More than enough sometimes,” Rose replied
quietly.</p>

<p>Lily Osborne laughed again, stooping a little
to lean both hands on the window-sill as she looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
out. At the touch of her flowing draperies Rose
drew back with instinctive repugnance. They
were naturally antagonistic, and the touch of her
dress, the sound of her voice, were distasteful.</p>

<p>The older woman noticed the movement instantly,
her perceptions were of the keenest. She
looked upon the girl as rather dull, if beautiful,
and as an unworthy adversary, yet she resented
her manner. Her cheek reddened and she bit her
lip as she stared down into the street with unseeing
eyes. The offense lay deeper; she had
never forgotten or forgiven the bridge whist
incident, nor the day when Judge Temple, an
important figure in the social world, failed to
see her. She turned and saw Rose looking at a
rough sketch of Fox. Allestree had done it in a
few moments when Fox was talking and unconscious
that he was a model. The result was
remarkable; the artist had caught his happiest
expression and the fine upward sweep of the
brow, the noble pose of the head. Rose saw it
for the first time and she had forgotten Lily
Osborne. She was looking at it with an absorbed
eye, her cheek pale.</p>

<p>The other woman read her as easily as an
open page; she moved over to her side and raised
her lorgnon. “Excellent,” she commented; “a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
splendid head, I always said so! You have heard
of the great divorce—Mrs. White from the secretary?”</p>

<p>Rose did not reply, she glanced anxiously
toward the door. They both heard steps on the
stairs and Mrs. Allestree’s voice panting at every
step. “Robert, I don’t care! Of course the man
cheats, they all do, but it’s a beauty and only
seventy-five dollars!”</p>

<p>Lily Osborne continued. “Of course Fox will
have to marry her, that’s the code, I believe!
Thank heaven, when I got my divorce I didn’t
have to marry to save myself! It’s such a pity
on his account, with his career, but the secretary
would be a fool not to divorce her, she—”</p>

<p>Rose turned coldly. “Pardon me,” she said,
with white lips, “I don’t care to listen to scandal,”
and she walked away to meet Mrs. Allestree,
her head up but her heart sinking within her.
The sheer misery that swept in upon her being,
chilling its natural happy calm, transforming all
the cheerful amenities of life, appalled her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">XV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO days later Mrs. Allestree rang the bell
at Margaret’s door with a sudden sensation
of panic. She had felt it her duty to go,
in spite of Robert’s protests, for the morning
newspaper had printed a scarcely veiled account
of the scandal in the Cabinet. White, it appeared,
had openly quarrelled with his wife and
abruptly left her the day before, publishing his
private affairs by going to a large hotel which
was crowded with fashionable guests. Society
caught its breath and waited—with the relish
that it usually waits—for a <i>cause célèbre</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s a cowardly thing to do, Robert,” Mrs.
Allestree declared hotly; “no man should expose
a woman to such a scandal. I shall go to see
Margaret to-day, it’s my duty!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, mother!” groaned Allestree,
“can’t you let it alone? What in the world
can you do?”</p>

<p>“Do? Robert!” the old lady’s bright eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
flashed, “I’m ashamed of you! Do you think I’ll
let people imagine that I believe my own nephew
is a scamp? Not a bit of it! And Margaret—the
child’s heart-broken, that’s all; I’ll never believe
a word against her! Of course he’ll marry
that Osborne woman.”</p>

<p>“Mother, mother! You know what Gerty told
us; Margaret herself is going to get the divorce,
she’s forced the situation.”</p>

<p>“Gerty’s a fool!” said his mother promptly and
unreservedly.</p>

<p>Then she put on her bonnet and went, but
as she approached the imposing house with its
great porte-cochère and its long row of fluted
white pillars, its upper balcony and its conservatory,
its flagrant and ostentatious wealth, her
heart sank drearily. Experience had taught her
that the very wealthy have their own way; moreover,
what could she say? What had she a right
to say? But she was a courageous old woman
and strong in her convictions; she rang the bell.
A tardy but irreproachable footman opened the
door and regarded her with a carefully impersonal
stare.</p>

<p>“Wonders who the old party is in an 1830
bonnet!” thought Mrs. Allestree amusedly, but
she inquired for Margaret and was admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
after an instant of hesitation which involved the
inspection of her card.</p>

<p>She waited a long while, it seemed to her, in
the dim drawing-room, and looked about her at
its luxuries and the long vista of the ballroom
beyond with a new interest. She had never been
a frequent visitor at the house and its aspect
was new and unnatural, its spacious and imposing
vacancy seemed to be accentuated by every touch
of the golden talisman; there was no atmosphere
of home. “Splendid misery,” she thought, and
sighed; there was not much to bind the heart
of a woman—a natural woman—here! She
listened, hoping to hear a child’s voice, even
the baby’s cry, but the stillness was perfect; it
was evidently a well ordered household even if
Margaret held the reins with a lax hand. Gerty
must be a tolerably good manager, Mrs. Allestree
thought with a prick of conscience, remembering
that Margaret put everything on Gerty’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>It was all dazzling enough, there were gold
nuggets in the very ceiling, fifteen carat, the old
woman recollected with a secret smile, and even
the pictures suggested great wealth; on the wall
opposite was “The Angelus” and beyond a
Reynolds which had cost White a fabulous sum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
He knew as little of art as he did of the kingdom
of heaven, but Margaret had married him for
money, and she seemed to have been inspired with
a grim contempt for it afterwards and loved to
scatter his wealth to the four winds of heaven.</p>

<p>After awhile a French maid came down and
asked Mrs. Allestree to come up stairs. Margaret,
it appeared, was only half recovered from
her attack at Mrs. O’Neal’s.</p>

<p>She was lying on a lounge by the open window
of her bedroom when the old woman entered,
and she greeted her with a languid smile. Her
white morning gown made her look paler than
usual, but she was the picture of indifference and
she had been viewing a new hat of a very pronounced
size and startling effect.</p>

<p>She held out a hand to Mrs. Allestree with an
odd little laugh. “Oh, how do you do?” she
said calmly; “you know Wicklow has gone off
and left me! I’m ordering a new hat to keep up
my spirits.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree sat down weakly in the nearest
chair. “Margaret!” she protested faintly.</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her from under her drooping
lashes. “Did you expect to find me in
tears?” she asked coolly.</p>

<p>Her visitor colored deeply; after all, Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
had been right, she had no justification, her well
meant sympathy was fruitless, her coming an intrusion.
“I suppose I shouldn’t have come here
at all,” she admitted reluctantly, her fine old
hands trembling a little in her lap, “but I came
to tell you that I had always loved you, Margaret.”</p>

<p>The younger woman looked at her strangely,
her face changing rapidly from defiance to a
shamed affection, the unlooked for tenderness
touched her sore heart; her stormy nature had
been passing through one of its eclipses, when
the light itself seemed to go out and leave her
groping blindly for relief, for hope, for an escape
from the intolerable situation which her own folly
and infatuation had created, and which kept closing
in upon her like the narrowing walls of the
inquisition dungeon. “I think it lovely of you
to say it,” she murmured, a little break in her
voice, her lip quivering as she averted her face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree’s eyes softened; she gave a hasty
glance about her, partly to assure herself that
they were alone and partly because she was just
realizing the fanciful splendor of Margaret’s surroundings.
The room was white and gold and
every article on her toilet-table was gold mounted,
every detail suggesting the height of luxurious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
sybaritism. “Margaret,” she began gently, “it
is never too late, can’t I do something to—to
bridge it over?”</p>

<p>Margaret’s lips stiffened, her momentary emotion
passing at the mere suggestion of a continuance
in the old intolerable relation. She shook
her head impatiently. “I wouldn’t bridge it
over if I could!” she exclaimed with passion.</p>

<p>But the old lady, foreseeing troubles which
would involve those near and dear to her, could
not give up so easily. “My dear child, it’s
dreadful! The woman always suffers—and your
husband’s high position, the publicity of it!”</p>

<p>Margaret shrugged her shoulders. “I can’t
help that!” she said scornfully, “I’ve borne it
long enough. Haven’t I a right to be happy?
A nursemaid might expect that, a cook! Why
shouldn’t I have a little happiness in my life?”</p>

<p>“You have so much!” Mrs. Allestree looked
about her, “everything wealth can purchase—and
the children! God has been good to you;
hasn’t He a right to chasten you a little?”</p>

<p>Her glance at the material comforts of the
room, her evident consideration of the wealth, the
worldly as well as the religious side of the question,
irritated Margaret anew, for she had no
tolerance for compromise, she had bought all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
things at too dear a cost, and knew it in the overwhelming
bitterness of her soul.</p>

<p>“What in the world do I care for all this if I
haven’t happiness?” she demanded bitterly, “and
I’ve never had it, never for a moment! Besides,
it’s all nonsense to argue about it; it’s over and
done with, thank God! We quarrelled irrevocably;
Wicklow wouldn’t forgive me if I’d
forgive him—and I never will!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Margaret, Margaret!” Mrs. Allestree
shook her head; “there are your children, you
must think of them, you’re bound to, my heart
aches for them!”</p>

<p>“Well, it needn’t! Mrs. White will bring them
up beautifully; she adores them, I don’t!” Margaret’s
thin cheeks were burning and her eyes
glowed dangerously; the children had been held
over her head too often, she was in no mood to
hear of them again.</p>

<p>“That’s the most wicked thing you’ve said!”
exclaimed her visitor with indignation; “you’ve
lost your mind, Margaret; you can’t expect happiness
feeling as you do! There, I know you’ll
despise me, but I’m an old woman, and I had to
speak my mind!”</p>

<p>Margaret raised herself on her elbow and
pointed an accusing finger. “Speak it,” she exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
with bitterness, “but—were you ever in
my place? Were you ever married to a man like
my husband, a man who was openly unfaithful to
you—who was the talk and the jest of the town
because of another woman? Were you ever made
to feel that you were bought, a mere chattel?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree looked at her in silence, her fine
old face grew pale, her lips trembled. Margaret
sank down again, her hand on her heart.</p>

<p>“You never were!” she said scornfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree wiped away her tears. “I meant
well,” she said, “but despise me, Margaret, I deserve
it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t despise you, I think you a dear,” Margaret
retorted, softening; “only you do not in
the least understand. It’s all right for you to
be so good and so pious, but I can’t be!”</p>

<p>“You’ve made me a wretched old hypocrite!”
said Mrs. Allestree; “oh, Margaret, you can be
just what you want to be, you are so clever, so
beautiful, so charming!”</p>

<p>Margaret shrugged her shoulders. “I’m a
miserable sinner, dear heart, it’s no use to try to
reform me.”</p>

<p>“You are wilful! Oh, child, it’s for you I
speak, you’ll regret it!” She bent forward and
patted the limp white hand that hung over the side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
of the lounge. From the bottom of her heart she
wished she knew how to reach her, but she had
been curiously defeated. “You’ll regret it all
your life; we women never can break the bonds.
Marriage is an incident in a man’s life; God didn’t
mean that women should feel the same about it.”</p>

<p>“A great many do break the bonds,” said Margaret
eagerly, “and begin all over again; why
shouldn’t I?” she spoke with the force of longing;
hour after hour she had argued thus with
herself, yet at a word her soul leaped up unconvinced
and the battle began all over again; that
inexorable law which binds a woman’s life and
fixes it in the orbit of eternity had laid hold upon
her.</p>

<p>“A great many do?” Mrs. Allestree’s thin lips
tightened and she looked away. Then she rose
and gathered up her gloves and her parasol and
her spectacles. “Too many, and what do people
say of most of them?” she added severely, regaining
a hold upon her shaken convictions.</p>

<p>Margaret bit her lip, there was a little spot of
color in each cheek, her heavy eyes shone with
feverish defiance. “I wish I were like you, I wish
I had lived your life, I should like to be good if I
could!” she said slowly, without mockery.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree turned red. “Don’t, Margaret!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
I’m really not the Pharisee or the Levite, only I
wanted to help you!”</p>

<p>“I meant just what I said,” Margaret retorted
quietly; “but I can’t be religious, I—I must be
loved, I must be happy, I should die just being
good!”</p>

<p>The old lady stooped and kissed her impetuously.
“You’re ill, child, and weak; wouldn’t
it do any good if I—I should go to see Mr.
White?”</p>

<p>“And bring him back here?” Margaret shuddered.
“My dear friend, I’m going to get out of
here to-morrow, I shall never come into this house
again!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree stood up shocked, the force of
Margaret’s hatred of White bit through all reserves.
The old woman felt her impotence, how
could she fight this will, this unscrupulous will to
be happy, happy at any price? “Where will you
go?” she asked helplessly.</p>

<p>“To Omaha. Of course I could get a divorce
anywhere, every one knows that! Oh, you
wouldn’t have borne all I’ve borne! But I shall
go to Omaha; I want to have it over soon and
I can stay there until I get it.”</p>

<p>“And the children?”</p>

<p>“I sent them over to Wicklow’s mother this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
morning; she was nearly in spasms for fear I’d
want the custody!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree stood looking at her a moment
in speechless amazement; then she surrendered.
“Good-bye, Margaret,” she said quietly; “I’m
a useless old fogy and busybody, I see it, but I
couldn’t help coming; I remember you running
about in short skirts with your hair in a pigtail.
Heaven knows I wish you were a child still and
as happy as you were then!”</p>

<p>Margaret sighed. “I wish I were!” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree tightened her bonnet ribbons
under her chin with shaking fingers, her heart
swelling with anger and disgust. A woman, the
mother of children, to behave like this! It was
monstrous! Behave like it herself? Never! Her
stern lips parted once to utter a word of rebuke,
but her courage failed her; she remembered
Robert’s remonstrances. After all, what right had
she to speak? “I wish you were, indeed!” she
repeated stiffly.</p>

<p>Her tone, something in her offended gesture,
reached Margaret’s heart. She rose, rose with a
visible effort, and went to her with an unsteady
step, throwing her arms around her neck, disarranging
the astonished old woman’s bonnet as she
did it. “Love me!” she sobbed, with the abandon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
of a child who has been punished, “love me—I’m
starving to be loved, to be taken care of, oh, don’t
you understand? I want to be happy!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of suspended indignation,
of doubt, then the old arms clasped her; if she
could but save this brand from the burning!
“Poor child!” she murmured, “you poor, unhappy,
misguided child! Let me be the peace-maker.”</p>

<p>It was a woeful mistake; Margaret raised her
head with a wild little laugh, pushing her away
again almost with force. “Oh, you’ll never understand
me!” she cried, with a finality which
was a sharp shock to her listener, “never! You
can never change me—I’d sell my soul to be
free!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOX had not seen Rose alone since that night,
now some weeks distant, when, after a
bitter struggle with himself, he had
definitely accepted the inexorable fact of Margaret’s
demand upon him. To injure a woman,
however unwittingly, seemed to him contemptible,
even when he secretly raged against the injustice
of her claims and repudiated them in his heart
with something akin to savage anger. It had been
a bitter experience, a shock to his egotism, to his
infatuated belief in himself, that belief which comes
sometimes to genius with the force of absolute
conviction.</p>

<p>The adjournment of Congress had left him
more at liberty than usual and he was anxious to
leave the city, yet to do so would be interpreted
as flight. He had purposely absented himself
from White’s house, and Margaret, understanding
his mood, had refrained from communicating with
him, but he was instinctively aware that she was
unshaken in her resolution, and the news of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
open rupture came to him almost as a relief; it
was over, and it was useless to indulge in vague
hopes and futile thoughts of escape from his responsibility;
he must meet the fate that his folly
and selfishness had invited, and with it the wreck
of his own happiness! And he was a strong
willed, selfish man; it was well nigh impossible to
yield to such a course, to give up, to let Rose go
just when it seemed most possible to win her. As
for Margaret, the manner in which he thought of
her, the wretched obstinacy with which her fate
entangled his, argued ill indeed for her future
hope of happiness if he married her. If he yielded
that reluctant assent to the situation, if he accepted
the claim she made upon him, it might be a
bare and cruel fate for both. He was himself unaware
of the impossibility of concealment, that his
final indifference would be more cruel, more deadly
than present repudiation. He thought, instead,
of himself, of the wreck of a dream which had
filled his soul with the beautiful and tender amenities
of love and loyalty and protection; he forgot
that a man can hide his heart as little as the
leopard can change his spots, and that a woman
can suffer more in its revelation than she would
from physical brutality.</p>

<p>All this while the thought of Rose came to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
with cruel regret. There were hours, between
daylight and dawn, when he walked the floor
battling with his own soul, battling with the irresistible
desire to go to her, to tell her that he
loved her, no matter what happened; let the universe
crumble, let her despise him for his weakness,
if she would, but to tell her the truth! It seemed
to him supremely worth the cost.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of one of those perfect
spring days when the cherry trees are white
with bloom behind the garden walls and all the
parks are full of robins. Fox had left his work in
his vacant committee-room at the Capitol, and
crossing the city was walking westward with no
companion but Sandy. The desire to see Rose
had crystallized in his heart even while he struggled
against it, and he turned almost unconsciously
in the direction of her home. He had
heard that very morning of the rumors, now
numerous and substantial, of Judge Temple’s
financial losses; one man had told him that the
judge was on the brink of ruin, and the thought
of distress and sorrow coming to her stung Fox
with renewed misery. As he came in sight of the
modest old house with its ivy mantled wall and its
white door, with the half moon of triangular
panes above it, and its fluted white pilasters on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
either side, he looked up over it with the feeling
of a man who had shut the gate of Paradise in his
own face. He had intended to pass it, crossing
on the street below, but at the corner Sandy
stopped and pricked his ears and then dashed
forward with a joyous bark of greeting, and his
master knew that he was betrayed.</p>

<p>Rose had just mounted her horse at her own
door and was dismissing the negro who had held
the reins. The sun shone full in her face and made
a nimbus of her soft bright hair, while her slim
figure in the saddle looked more youthful than
ever. She had recognized Sandy and greeted him
with a kindly word as he leaped at her stirrup,
and seeing his master behind him, she held in her
restless horse and waited quietly, only a slight
deepening of the color in her cheeks indicating the
tumult in her heart. She had schooled herself for
the moment and even in the shock of unexpected
meeting her training held good; she was more composed
than he was, as she answered his greeting.
But, at a glance, he saw the change in her, the
reserve in her eyes, the slightness of her smile, and
taking offense at what seemed to him an injustice,
he overlooked the fact that it was the baldest, the
most pitiful acting of one who had never dissembled
before in her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“It’s too perfect a day to be indoors,” she
said, with a lightness of tone which shocked her
own ears; “I am going down by the speedway
to see the river and that soft haze which I know
is lying over on the Virginia shore; in the afternoon
sun it looks like a mirage.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should enjoy the sight,” Fox
said dryly; “life has been too much of a mirage
to me lately.”</p>

<p>She looked down at him, the sun illuminating
her beautiful eyes. “Life?” she repeated, with
sudden girlish enthusiasm; “isn’t it what we
make it? We owe it to ourselves—that moral
responsibility.”</p>

<p>He laughed with bitterness; her childishness
struck him with renewed force; she could never
understand his impossible situation; she would
condemn him, and he deserved it! “Moral responsibility!”
he repeated, with sudden fury,
“what cant it is. I’d be willing to cast it all into
Hades for one moment of liberty from these
wretched shackles which ‘make cowards of us all!’
No living man can control his life where it touches
another’s.”</p>

<p>She shrank instinctively, with a sharp moral
recoil, from his impassioned words, coloring
deeply. Her hands trembled as she held the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
bridle, and even that slight motion made her horse
swerve, eager to be off. Intuition, swift and unerring,
interpreted his words and his sudden stress
of feeling. “Pardon me,” she said simply, “I
did not mean to set myself up as a judge. I suppose
I’m very ignorant of such matters and—I
would rather be so,” she added with gentle
dignity.</p>

<p>He looked at her deeply touched. “My God,
Rose,” he murmured, “leave me; if you stay a
moment longer I must speak, and you will never
forgive me!”</p>

<p>Her lip trembled like a child’s, but her clear
eyes were full of a grave condemnation; yet she
was deeply moved; he had never called her by her
name before, and the sound of it upon his lips,
the very way in which it was uttered voiced his
heart; she could not close her ears to it, no matter
how much she struggled with herself, and she did
struggle, determined to hide her own pang of anguished
regret. For a moment neither spoke,
then she leaned slightly from her saddle and held
out her hand. “Let us part friends,” she said in
a voice of restraint.</p>

<p>He did not take her hand; he groaned. “I
cannot!” he exclaimed with renewed bitterness;
“do not offer a sop to a starving man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Her horse plunged and she grasped the bridle
again with both hands. Her face changed so completely
that it seemed to him a strange face. He
could not read it but he believed that, in her heart,
she condemned him, that he appeared to her in the
guise of Mephistopheles himself. Yet, as she turned
and looked back at him, there was an expression in
her eyes at once inscrutable and beautiful; he
could never be sure how far it confessed her heart.
Had she loved him? It was impossible to know,
and he stood mute watching her slight figure outlined
against the sun as she galloped down the
long quiet street, under an arcade of new green,
wreathed here and there with the bloom of the
tulip trees, narrowing at last to an arched vista of
luminous sky above blue distant hills; its stillness
and its new thick foliage shutting from view, at
once of mind and eye, the city life which enfolded
it, and was shut out by its gracious gift of leafage,
which hid long rows of houses or clothed
them with imaginary beauty.</p>

<p>Fox stood still, rooted to the spot, his mind
darkened by the fierce tumult of feeling which
clamored against fate and against Margaret.
She had broken with him long ago, what right
had she to thrust herself into his life? Then the
picture of her in her forlorn grief, in her appeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
to him, came back with an abruptness which wrung
a groan from his lips. What man, so placed as
he, could fling her unhappy love in her face?</p>

<p>And Rose? What she believed of him, shaping
her thoughts by that stern old moralist her father,
it was not difficult to imagine!</p>

<p>He started to self-consciousness as Sandy, tired
of waiting, suddenly jumped up and pawed his
arm. Coming to himself again he flushed hotly at
the discovery that some chance passers-by were
staring at him, and whistling to the dog he walked
rapidly away, the battle still raging in his soul
with bitterness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rose had turned her horse’s head
through less frequented streets toward the White
Lot, and galloping through the bridle paths
around the ellipse, she turned and crossing the
street rode down to the speedway, the sun shining
athwart her path and the river lying before her
a sheet of silver.</p>

<p>As she had anticipated, a soft haze floated on
the farther shore, the sun seemed to turn the very
mist to gold, and through this glowing, impalpable
atmospheric vapor she saw the beautiful
swelling hills, half fledged in tenderest green, the
shadows purple, the distances melting into the sky
itself. Across the river a flock of birds winged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
their flight, vanishing at last into the heart of the
west.</p>

<p>The long white road stretched smooth and bare
to the water’s edge, she heard the tide lap the
sand, and the sharp hoofbeats of her horse rang
clear. It was almost deserted; some social function
had drawn the tide of carriages and motors
elsewhere; a few stragglers passed her, but she
galloped on. Behind her the city dropped away
into silence, the foliage in the open spaces of the
park and the White House grounds almost hiding
the public buildings and clothing the whole with a
sylvan aspect. Some children paddled at the
water’s edge; a boy cast his net; the prattle of
their voices came up through the clear soft air.</p>

<p>Rose checked her horse and sat looking across
the river, shading her eyes with her hand. The
sight of Fox, the sound of his voice had unnerved
her. She had thought herself strong enough to
dismiss him from her mind, to live down that
dream, that idle futile dream, but she found that
she had not counted the cost, that she had suffered
a serious hurt. Already Rose’s inner mind
began to question her own judgment. She knew
nothing of the circumstances; had she a right
to condemn him? Secretly she blamed Margaret;
what woman does not blame the other woman a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
little? What woman does not know that the
other’s charming ways, her skill, her beauty,
may have captured the unwary male creature
almost against his will and certainly against
his better judgment? Eve would never have
blamed Adam in her heart if there had been
any one for Adam to flirt with, but therein lay
Eve’s profound superiority over her descendants—she
was the only woman!</p>

<p>But Rose knew Margaret, knew her charm, her
subtilty, her daring, and she battled with herself,
trying to beat down her secret condemnation of
the woman only. She was a stern little moralist,
and she tried to be just; Fox must be to blame
also, for was not Margaret married? The enormity
of his offense could not be excused; besides,
as she reflected, with a gnawing pain at her heart,
of what avail to argue? If the divorce was
granted—and it would be, beyond a doubt—Fox
would marry Margaret.</p>

<p>Her lips tightened, her hands grasped the
bridle again, and she galloped on, a wave of misery
sweeping over her young soul, blotting out
the bright contentment of her life, her natural
cheerfulness. Suddenly she thought of that day
a year ago, how happy she had been! She remembered
it, a bright beautiful day, and she and Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Allestree and Robert had driven out to Rock
Creek Park and she had found some wood violets.
A few months, and her old life had been blotted
out, her happiness clouded; even her affection for
her father seemed overshadowed, her whole being
preoccupied and absorbed with this new misery.
Was this then what men called love? Alack, she
wished that she had never met the little blind god,
or meeting him, had passed unscathed!</p>

<p>She turned her horse’s head and rode slowly
back; the scent of flowers, of sweet new grass,
of the fresh turned earth came to her, and the
sweet treble note of a song-sparrow, but the world
would never be quite the same again; she had met
life face to face and learned one of its profound
lessons. The young purity of her soul refused
to accept it as a common lot, and it was characteristic
of the sweetness of her temperament that,
however she suffered, she did not blame Fox for
having deliberately won her love, but she shrank,
with almost physical repugnance, from the
thought of him as the lover of a married woman.
The judge’s lessons had gone even deeper than
he knew.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">GERTRUDE ENGLISH, with her hands
clasped behind her, stood looking over
Allestree’s shoulder and watching him as
he worked, in a desultory way, at some details of
Margaret’s now nearly finished portrait. It was
good work, but it lacked the inspiration of his
picture of Rose; it had been, indeed, well nigh
impossible to convey the mockery, the uninterpreted
mystery of Margaret’s glance.</p>

<p>“You haven’t made the face half sad enough,”
was Gerty’s candid criticism, “and her eyes—do
you suppose any one else ever had quite such
eyes?”</p>

<p>Allestree smiled. “I was going to say that I
hoped not, but I suppose you would construe that
as a want of appreciation.”</p>

<p>Miss English opened her own eyes. “Of course
I should,” she said promptly, “and I can’t see
what you mean; her eyes are lovely!”</p>

<p>“Admitted!” he said teasingly; “you can’t
understand me, Gerty; I have vagaries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Oh, I suppose that’s genius, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Precisely, genius is a form, a mild one, of
adolescent insanity.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t get violent while I’m here, Robert,”
she retorted; “I have enough of whirlwind
and tornado just now with Margaret. Heavens,
how glad I’d be if I didn’t have to go to Omaha
with her!”</p>

<p>“Poor child, must you?” Allestree stopped
painting and looked around with open sympathy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I must,” Gerty replied with resignation;
“I’m homely and poor, Robert, and they
will take me along labelled—‘Propriety, reduced
gentlewoman as secretary and chaperon, age near
thirty, conduct exemplary, travelling expenses
paid!’”</p>

<p>“I’d take to the woods, Gerty!” he laughed,
not without sympathy; he dimly imagined the
sting under the words.</p>

<p>“Or do something outrageous and get sent
home—I wish I could, but I’d starve,” Gerty said
calmly; “nothing else keeps me in the straight
and narrow way but the fact that meat is twenty
cents a pound and bread five. Isn’t it sordid? But
I’m really dreadfully sorry for Margaret!”</p>

<p>“I was beginning to lose sight of that fact,”
remarked Allestree dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“I’m not sorry for Fox though,” she added,
laughing maliciously.</p>

<p>Allestree frowned, concentrating his attention
on the picture again. “It’s a wretched business,”
he observed.</p>

<p>Gerty walked to the window and looked out;
when she came back her face was flushed. “Robert,
do you know I’m afraid that I did something
wrong the other day,” she broke out; “I’m nearly
sure I did!”</p>

<p>He looked at her smiling grimly. “You forgot
about the scale of domestic necessities then,
Gerty?” he said.</p>

<p>But she ignored him. “I went to see Rose
some time ago, just after Margaret told me, and
I talked—I talked too much.”</p>

<p>“The unruly member, alas!” he mocked, laughing
now.</p>

<p>“I did,” she replied. “I told her about Fox
and Margaret—and Robert,” Gerty paused and
dropped into a convenient chair, “Robert, she
turned as white as a ghost! Is it possible, do
you think it’s possible that she loves Fox? I
never thought of it until Lily Osborne told me
so last week.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Osborne—why do you listen to Mrs.
Osborne?” Allestree broke out, with a fury which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
astounded Miss English; “she has no right to
speak of Rose Temple, it’s—it’s an outrage!”</p>

<p>Gerty stared at him a moment in silence, her
face reddening still more with the horrified recognition
of another blunder; of course she knew that
he had always loved Rose, in fact she had discounted
his devotion as too stale an affair to be
really vital. “I know Lily Osborne is a cat, <i>of</i>
course,” she said slowly, “but then one can’t be
rude without any given reason. She didn’t say a
word against Rose, and I suppose it’s natural
enough if Fox has admired her; everybody does.”</p>

<p>But Allestree was not appeased. “Mrs. Osborne!”
he broke out again, “of all women—Mrs.
Osborne! Gerty, don’t you let her say a
word to you again.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Robert, I shan’t dare squeak
after this!” Miss English retorted plaintively;
“and, of course, Mrs. Osborne will marry White
and, they say, he’s going to lose his place in
the Cabinet. What on earth has she been doing
about the Russian and German ambassadors?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Allestree sharply, “and
I don’t care!”</p>

<p>Gerty rose abruptly and picked up her parasol.
“Robert,” she said with feeling, “you’re
like a bear with a sore head, and I always said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
you had such a nice disposition; I should have
fallen in love with you myself if I hadn’t had a
snub nose and freckles.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself Robert laughed. “Was that
an insurmountable barrier, Gerty?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; snub nosed girls never fall in
love with artists, it isn’t profitable!” and Gerty
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>As she did so she glanced out of the open
window. “There’s Rose now,” she said and beckoned
gayly; “she’ll come up and make amends
for my blunders!” she laughed.</p>

<p>Allestree colored hotly, aware that he had betrayed
himself; the amazing indelicacy of Gerty’s
raillery was not inconsistent with her usual careless
freedom of speech which gave much unwitting
pain and had cost her correspondingly dear more
than once, yet it made him wince to encounter
it, to feel her thoughtless probe sink into the
dearest recesses of his heart and be powerless to
resent it. Frankness, after all, is frequently a
doubtful virtue; like a two-edged sword it cleaves
both ways and leaves no healing balsam in its
train. It was Margaret White who always said
that an expert and comfortable liar was an absolute
blessing to society.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rose had dismounted at the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and come up stairs with no other motive than
a desire to escape her own society. The sight
of Gerty at the window furnished her with an
excuse, and she came in still pale, in spite of her
swift gallop by the river, and with a look in her
eyes which shocked Allestree; he had never seen
pain in her look before. Miss English greeted
her affectionately; at heart she was really penitent.</p>

<p>“I came up here to see Lily Osborne’s picture,”
she declared, “and Robert has sent it off
already! Isn’t it a shame? I hadn’t seen it.”</p>

<p>“It was excellent,” Rose replied soberly, taking
the chair Allestree pushed forward for
her; “she really is a beauty, Gerty; I like to say
that to show myself just and broad-minded!”</p>

<p>“That makes two pictures Robert has finished
this winter;—yours and the serpent’s, as I call
Lily Osborne, and now he is nearly done with
Margaret.”</p>

<p>“Not many, if I’m to make a living by it,
Gerty,” Allestree retorted smiling.</p>

<p>“A living? Goodness, if I could only get
your prices!” Gerty raised her eyes and hands
to heaven; “I’m a poor thing worth a dollar an
hour and expenses.”</p>

<p>“Raise your rates, Gerty, you’re indispensable,”
said Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Indeed I’m not, there are lots of others waiting
for my shoes. Good-bye, dear children; I’m
going now to write two dozen notes, pay fifty
bills and interview a caterer and a florist,” and
she kissed her hand to them as she withdrew, mischievously
aware that she had coaxed Rose into
an interview with Allestree; like Judge Temple,
Gerty thought happiness lay in this direction and
in no other.</p>

<p>As she disappeared Rose left her chair and
went to look at Margaret’s portrait with dreamy
eyes. “I must go, too,” she said, “I only stopped
for a moment on my way. I’ve been riding by
the river and through the White Lot. I kept
thinking of those lines, do you remember them,
Robert?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘Hast thou seen by daisied leas,</div>
<div class="verse">And by rivers flowing</div>
<div class="verse">Lilac-ringlets which the breeze</div>
<div class="verse">Loosens, lightly blowing!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“I’ve been longing to be out all day myself,”
he said soberly enough, “to see the ‘lilac-ringlets,’
but I must finish this; in some way I have
grown to believe that Margaret will never again
be quite the Margaret we have known so long. I
wanted to be sure of this expression.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>Rose looked again at the picture, and her lip
quivered a little in spite of herself. “Yes,” she
replied simply, “I understand you; I don’t believe
you will see that old look again. I feel—”
she paused, choosing her words, her eyes darkening
with an emotion which she was controlling
with an effort—“I feel as if Margaret had died,
that some one else would come back to us, some
one we do not know!”</p>

<p>It was a striking fact that at the very moment
when Margaret believed that she was about to
achieve happiness, her friends regarded her as
approaching its final eclipse. One moment of detachment,
of the external view-point, would open
an appalling vista to many a human soul, for it
is true that those whom the gods desire to destroy
they first make blind.</p>

<p>As Rose voiced this thought Allestree averted
his eyes; he felt the keenest regret for his thoughtless
words; Gertrude English’s unmerciful tongue
had torn away the veil from Rose’s emotions. He
would have been more than human had not his
heart burned with a sudden fierce anger. What
right had Fox, who had so much, to step in between
him and the girl he loved,—to wound a heart so
delicate, so sensitive, so tender as hers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“I pity Margaret!” he said sharply, with some
bitterness, “but he who sows the tares—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to judge,” Rose rejoined quietly;
“father is very bitter against divorce; he thinks
it a menace to the national existence, and I know
I think always as he does and—perhaps I’m hard,
Robert;” as she spoke she looked at him appealingly,
resting her slender, ungloved hand on the
easel beside Margaret’s portrait; her whole attitude
was one of regret, of reluctance.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like to speak of it too often,” he
said in a low voice, “as it stands—in the bare
aspect that we see it—Margaret’s plain justification
is lost in what we know to be her wild determination
to be happy at any price.”</p>

<p>Rose sighed. His words revealed her own
thought, she knew that Margaret sought divorce
to marry Fox; it was hideous to her, unpardonable,
and Fox? She was silent, looking at the pictured
face, seeing its mystical beauty, that weird
suggestion of an unhappy fate which seemed to
shadow its wild loveliness. Allestree had only
dimly conveyed it, but Rose’s memory supplied
the details. No wonder that men fell under her
spell; there was a charm as subtle as it was absolute
in her whole personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Ah, well,” Rose said at last, “it is natural—she
is wonderful.”</p>

<p>She had almost forgotten Allestree, so absorbed
was she in her own thoughts; and he saw her
emotion and raged again at the thought of it.
With a sudden impulse he bent and kissed the hand
upon the easel. Rose started violently and blushed
with painful emotion.</p>

<p>“Robert!” she exclaimed reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Can I say nothing?” he replied with passion;
“must I stand by like a mute and let my happiness,
my love, my life slip away from me? Rose,
you ask too much!”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry!” she said simply, “now I must
go and—and I hate to seem unkind, Robert!”</p>

<p>Their eyes met with the shock of natural feeling
and his face blanched. “Of course I know it’s
useless, Rose, I’ve always known it, but—well, I
had to speak, and you’ll have to forgive me for
it!”</p>

<p>She smiled faintly. “There’s nothing to forgive,”
she said gently, “and I must go home to
meet father anyway. Won’t you come with me,
Robert?”</p>

<p>Without a word he laid down his brushes and
the two went down the old stairs together, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
miserable enough in different ways; the man bitterly
rebellious, the girl resolutely enduring with
a self repression that suggested her father in
her.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XVIII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT very day Judge Temple violated his
usual custom and did not come home
promptly after court adjourned. The
hour came and passed and he had not appeared.</p>

<p>Rose was waiting for him in the library and
she began to glance uneasily at the clock. His
habits were as fixed as the laws of the Medes and
Persians; any deviation indicated something out
of the common. These spring evenings it was his
custom to walk in the garden before dinner. Rose
had accordingly opened the long French window
on the piazza and the tendrils of the jasmine vine,
not yet budding, swung across it; the air was
sweet, redolent with the perfume of the wistaria
which hung in festoons on the arbor. The sweet
full note of a catbird broke the stillness.</p>

<p>Rose walked to and fro, trying to distract her
mind; if she relaxed a moment she heard Fox’s
voice, saw his strong pale face. It was pathetically
significant that Allestree, and Allestree’s pain
at her finality had dropped from her mind. Love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
and youth are absolutely selfish, they ignore the
universe.</p>

<p>When she came home that day and was alone in
her room, she had shed some passionate tears; her
young strong heart had rebelled utterly; she
wanted happiness too, wanted it as bitterly as Margaret
did, but Margaret had robbed her of it! She
gave way then to the passion and the rage of her
grief, she forgot all Christian maxims, and in her
heart stormed against Margaret again, not against
Margaret’s lover. But the fury of her mood
passed, leaving her pale and wan, exhausted by it,
but still unsubmissive. It was no longer an unusual
thing to wash away the stains of tears and
go down stairs with a smile. It occurred to her
as she smoothed her rumpled hair and made her
toilet for the evening that she had learned the
alphabet of deceit too easily, she was a veritable
whited sepulchre. Nevertheless she went down
bravely to meet her father and take up her life
just where she had broken off for those few hours
of mad grief and restlessness. But the delay
fretted her nerves; it was one thing to be ready,
another to keep that smile, that brave air of comfort
for an hour, two hours, three! She grew uneasy,
too, for the judge,—could he be ill? Could
anything have happened? A dim foreboding crept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
through the preoccupation of her mood. She ran
to the front window and looked down the long
street and saw her father coming slowly toward
the house, his head slightly bowed and his tall
thin figure showing more than usually the student’s
stoop of the shoulders. The last rays of sunlight
slanting down the street fell on the whiteness of
his beard and hair.</p>

<p>A swift, pained perception of his age, his feebleness,
gave Rose a sudden sharp pang of grief, of
foreshadowed loss; the revelation that comes suddenly—like
the opening of a window in the soul—of
the mortality of those we love, of life’s awful
uncertainty.</p>

<p>She opened the door with a pale face.
“Father!” she exclaimed, “you’re so late, I was
getting anxious.”</p>

<p>He looked up without a smile, his eyes dull and
weary. “I was delayed—by business matters,”
he said simply.</p>

<p>He followed her into the library, and putting
down a bundle of papers he carried sank wearily
into his great chair and hid his face in his hands
without another word.</p>

<p>Rose looked at him keenly, her heart throbbing
with a new dismay, and seeing that the fingers
which pressed his temples slightly trembled she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
went to the dining-room and pouring out a glass
of wine brought it to him. “You are very tired,”
she said gently; “try to take this, father, I think
you need it.”</p>

<p>He looked up blankly, took the glass and tasting
the wine set it aside. His face had aged ten
years.</p>

<p>In her distress Rose only thought of cheering
him. She averted her eyes; it seemed almost an
indelicacy to inquire too closely into such apparent
distress. “The roses I ordered came to-day,” she
said, with a forced lightness of tone which jarred;
“I thought, perhaps, we could decide this evening
where to set them out. Do you think they’d do
best by the south wall, father?”</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his eyes like a man
whose sight was failing. “The roses?” he repeated
absently; “I do not know. My child,”
he added in a heavy tone, “something has happened
to-day; I’m practically a ruined man.”</p>

<p>She caught her breath, frightened for the moment
and taken unawares; in the assured comfort
and peace of her life it seemed impossible. “Oh,
father!” she exclaimed, “not really?”</p>

<p>He nodded, speech was difficult; the full force
and horror of the calamity still hung over him.</p>

<p>A hundred conjectures darted through her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
mind, but intuitively she knew the actual fact, his
trust had been betrayed. “It’s that man—the
note you endorsed?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied simply, “that and the unfortunate
investments I made in New York. They
turned out badly two months ago; I did not tell
you, Rose, but I was swindled. This morning the
note came due and Erkhardt has disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the villain!” Rose exclaimed hotly, “and
you so kind. Father, can’t it be delayed—warded
off? Surely something can be done—must you
lose all that too?”</p>

<p>He roused himself with an effort from the cloud
which seemed to be enfolding him, shutting down
on his stupefied senses. “I shall have to pay the
whole obligation; it can’t be honorably delayed,”
he said; “it will sweep away my whole principal,
Rose, and leave me nothing but my salary.”</p>

<p>“But we can live on that,” she exclaimed
eagerly, her face brightening, “we can easily live
on that, father; you’ll see how famously I can
manage!”</p>

<p>The judge looked at her with a pitiful tightening
of the lines about his mouth, his eyes filled with
unshed tears; her ignorance seemed to him the
sweetest, the most helpless thing in the world.
“But when I die, Rose,” he said hoarsely, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
I may die soon—” he rose and walked to and fro
before the open window where the soft twilight was
falling. He was suddenly bowed with years,
shrunken, haggard. “My God, child, there will
be nothing for you!” he broke out at last.</p>

<p>She went to him then, throwing her young arms
around his neck and staying him in his walk. He
looked at her, bewildered, and she laid her soft
cheek against his in a mute caress. “It doesn’t
matter, father!” she whispered; “don’t think of
me, don’t add that to your burden.”</p>

<p>The old man groaned. “My child,” he exclaimed,
his voice quavering with grief, “my poor
child, I can never forgive myself!”</p>

<p>Tears of sympathy filled her eyes, but she smiled
bravely. “Why, father, we have so much—here
is the house, the—”</p>

<p>“It’s mortgaged,” he said, and sank heavily
into his chair.</p>

<p>For an instant Rose stood appalled. Unconsciously
she glanced about her; in the gathering
gloom the dear familiar room, the book-lined walls,
the littered table, the old clock, seemed suddenly
changed. Between yesterday and to-day, between
this morning and to-night was a great gulf fixed.
She shivered, a horrible sensation of loss, of unreality,
of despair, swept over her young soul and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
bared it to misery, the poignant, unreasoning misery
of youth. Then she saw the bowed white head,
the bent shoulders which had borne the heat and
burden of the day, and forgot herself. She knelt
by his chair and slipped her arms around his neck.
“Nothing matters, dear daddy, while we have each
other,” she whispered, a little sob in her voice.</p>

<p>He put his shaking hand on her head. “My
poor child,” he repeated.</p>

<p>She raised her head, a soft light in her eyes.
“Father, you’ll let me sing now,” she said, “you’ll
let me sing—I know I can make a fortune for
us both. Mancini told me that with a year in
Paris I could be ready. He believes in my voice,
father, and you know he has trained two great
sopranos.”</p>

<p>The judge shook his head sadly. “Child, child,
you know how I feel about your singing in public!”</p>

<p>“But now, daddy,” she pleaded, “now when it
will save me from poverty, and I love it, oh, I love
it! May I go, just for six months?”</p>

<p>Again the judge shook his head, his lips almost
formed “no,” but Rose’s arms tightened around
his neck.</p>

<p>“Don’t say it, daddy!” she cried, “don’t say
it, for then you will not unsay it! Truly, truly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
I must sing, it is my greatest desire, my happiness,
the talent that was given me—surely I mustn’t be
the one to fold it in a napkin! Daddy, daddy, say
yes.”</p>

<p>He sat looking out of the window with unseeing
eyes, his lips compressed. The demand struck at
his dearest prejudices, his firmest convictions, yet
to leave her helpless and poor!</p>

<p>In the still room the ticking of the clock sounded
with monotonous distinctness; it seemed to jar
the silence. Twilight fell fast, the corners were
dark, the two faces in the foreground showed white
and tense.</p>

<p>At last the judge sighed heavily. “I must give
in,” he said, with slow reluctance, “in my folly
I have wrecked us both; I’m no longer fit to command.
You may sing, child, but I hope it will
only be in concerts.”</p>

<p>Rose’s face fell but hope kindled, one step was
gained, and like every wedge it makes the other
easier. “But I must go abroad to be finished for
any really great success,” she said; “father,
can’t you go with me?”</p>

<p>The judge looked at her strangely. “Child, I
never thought,” he said harshly; “I haven’t the
money to send you yet,—you’ll have to wait until
we can save it; it’s another denial for you, Rose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
You know I sent a large check to Allestree the
other day, and there is little left now.”</p>

<p>A wild hope leaped in her heart, she knew the
check would come back, but dared she tell him?
Would he take it if it came? Her lips trembled,
she was glad of the darkness. “Father, I shall
sing,” she said bravely, “perhaps,—who knows,—I
shall sing so well that you’ll be proud of me
and sit and applaud and send me bouquets.”</p>

<p>He wiped away the gathering moisture in his
eyes. “I’ve always been proud of you, Rose!” he
said sadly, “but that a child of mine should have
to sing for a living! The Lord’s hand is heavy
upon me in my old age,” he added pitifully, completely
broken down.</p>

<p>The girl’s arms were closer about his neck; her
own sorrow, her thoughts of Fox were lost in her
love for the old man in his distress. “Who
knows?” she cried with new sweet courage, almost
gay in her bravery, “perhaps I shall be as lucky as
Patti and we’ll have a great fortune and a palace
to live in! Oh, daddy, I shall be so happy to
sing!”</p>

<p>But he sat motionless, his chin upon his breast
and his dull eyes fixed on the open space beyond
the window where the lilac bush stood like a ghost
amidst the gathering night.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOX sat at his writing-table turning over
and signing some papers left there in methodical
order by his stenographer. He
was going out of town at last, and the thought
of escape from the oppression of the last few weeks
was like a breath of sweet fresh air from the hills
where he was born. But even with the prospect of
this reprieve he did his work mechanically, glancing
up occasionally at the waving tree-tops which
were on a level with his open windows and limited
his view.</p>

<p>Sandy lay at his feet waiting impatiently for his
daily run and in sympathy with his master’s mood.
Fox spoke to him once or twice as he paused in
his work, and once he bent down and caressed the
faithful creature’s head; there was comfort in the
sense of dumb companionship. Yet at this very
moment of depression he was aware that he had
achieved a signal political triumph. His last
speech before the closing of Congress had resounded
from one end of the country to the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
and been caught up and echoed abroad. He had
healed a breach in the party, plucked victory from
defeat, and his name was on every lip.</p>

<p>A few months ago the significance of it would
have stirred him deeply, his keen political foresight
would have shown him the greatest possibilities;
now it was dead sea fruit. He knew that in
a year, perhaps in less time, he must take a step
which would inflict a sharp injury to his career,
which would, perhaps, lose him his popularity
forever.</p>

<p>And a few weeks ago how differently the world
had looked! Then such a victory as he might now
easily win would have meant greater honor to offer
to the girl he loved.</p>

<p>His lips tightened and he bent to his work. He
was still reading and signing letters when there
was a knock at his door, and he opened it to admit
Louis Berkman. Berkman had been away and,
returning but a few days before, was not fully
aware of the current gossip, but he had just heard
of Fox’s achievement and came in with breezy congratulations.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I always said you had it in
you! Some day we shall get you in the White
House!”</p>

<p>Fox laughed a little bitterly. “It will be a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
day, Berkman,” he said coolly; “the newspapers
make a great deal of fuss over a small matter.”</p>

<p>“Not at all! I just saw Wingfield, and you
know he hasn’t much reason to love you; he told
me that you’d be Secretary of State in three
months.”</p>

<p>Fox bit his lip. “Wingfield’s an old fool!” he
retorted sharply.</p>

<p>Berkman laughed. “Oh, I know about White,
he’ll have to go; I’m jolly sorry on account of his
wife, she’s no end of fun! What the devil has he
been doing with that Osborne woman’s help? I
heard in New York that she had sold information
to Wall Street and something about our Navy to
Japan.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that!” said Fox flatly; “White
hasn’t done that, it’s only meant as an attack on
him of course. They say everything of Mrs. Osborne,
they always have, and that dirty sheet in
New York has published a lot of lies; it ought
to be suppressed.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless White will go out; I hear that
everywhere,” said Berkman obstinately; “and then
you’ll come in.”</p>

<p>Fox smiled with exceeding bitterness. “Then
I shall not come in,” he retorted quietly; “I shan’t
go into the Cabinet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Something in his tone at last warned Berkman,
and he colored deeply with embarrassment. Certain
vague rumors took shape in his mind and he
remembered suddenly Margaret’s mood after they
had left Fox and Rose together in Rock Creek
Park. He reached over and took a cigarette from
the box on the table and lighted it to hide his confusion.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” he said, with assumed
lightness of tone; “the Cabinet isn’t as brilliant
an opportunity as the House. At any rate I congratulate
you, my dear fellow, and I wish you all
success.”</p>

<p>Fox thanked him dryly and asked a few desultory
questions about Berkman’s trip and his new
book which was in press.</p>

<p>“It will be out in about ten days,” the author
said calmly, “and then my friends will make a business
of sending me all the adverse criticisms. If
I didn’t like to see the favorable ones occasionally
I shouldn’t need to employ clipping bureaus. I’m
hanged if I see the point of view which makes it a
duty to be disagreeable!”</p>

<p>Fox laughed. “My dear fellow, our friends
never realize us. I remember the first speech I ever
made at the primaries; I was a little flushed with
success; I’d had some applause, but suddenly I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
heard a voice, the sharp high voice of my childhood’s
neighbor, an old Methodist deacon, and it
said: ‘Well, I’m beat if it ain’t Billy Fox makin’
a speech, an’ the last time I saw him I was mighty
nigh givin’ him a lickin’ for fishin’ on Sunday in
my pool!’ By heavens,” Fox added with sudden
bitterness, “I wish I were fishing there now; how
cool and deep the shadows were!”</p>

<p>“Trout, of course?” said Berkman sympathetically.</p>

<p>Fox nodded. “Big ones; there was a willow
behind the pool; we cut our whistles there and hid
there when we saw old man Siddons coming. Lord,
Berkman, how the past slips away!”</p>

<p>“You ought to go back there now,” said the
author abruptly, as he rose; “I never saw you so
pale; have you been ill?”</p>

<p>“Never better; you know that like Prosper
Merimée I am naturally of the color of the pale
horse in the Apocalypse.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said Berkman, knocking the ashes
from his cigarette, “I don’t envy you public life;
it’s a harness, Fox, and a pretty tight harness too,
I fancy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall see a great deal more of
it,” Fox answered, with an enigmatical smile.</p>

<p>Berkman stared. “You!” he exclaimed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
“you’re at the threshold, man; in another year
or so the country will be clamoring for you.”</p>

<p>“Or against me,” said Fox scornfully; “wait
a moment,” he added, with a complete change of
tone, “I’ll go with you, this room suffocates me
to-day, it’s full of vapors!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile old Mrs. Allestree sat opposite to
Judge Temple in his library; the door was closed
and they were alone save for the birds in the
garden, for the windows were wide open, cool
striped awnings shading the room from the warm
glow of the afternoon, which steeped that secluded
spot in slumberous calm.</p>

<p>“Stephen, I’m the criminal,” she said firmly,
“Robert had nothing whatever to do with it;
there’s your old check and you’ve got to keep
it!”</p>

<p>The judge colored painfully; he had aged
twenty years in the last few weeks and his old
friend saw it. Once or twice she had winked back
her tears but her voice was acrid.</p>

<p>“I can’t keep it and keep the picture,” he said
firmly; “Robert has earned the money; I distinctly
stipulated that I should pay the regular
price for the portrait.”</p>

<p>“And Robert never meant you should! My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
dear friend, you and I know that he loves Rose;
why hurt the boy’s feelings?”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason why I can’t accept it, don’t
you see—” the judge stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>The old woman nodded. “Yes,” she said, “I
see; I know Rose doesn’t love him; I wish she did,
I hope and pray she may! But that’s neither here
nor there; as for the money, Robert won’t have
it.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall return the picture, and I should
like to keep it, especially if Rose goes abroad.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with exasperation. “You
know Rose can’t go without that money; you just
admitted that you couldn’t afford it!”</p>

<p>“Which was not an appeal for charity,” flashed
the judge hotly.</p>

<p>“Stephen, I’m ashamed of you!” she exclaimed,
then her eyes brightened and she looked at him
with new defiance. “You can’t have the picture,
Robert will keep it; he loves it better than anything
else; you shan’t insult him with money for
it; I won’t have it, sir! Where are your old ideas
of chivalry? One would suppose that you were
one of these new vulgar people who think that
money is the criterion of everything, that they
can buy shares in paradise! You’ve lived too long
in the neighborhood of the new rich; I’m really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
ashamed of you. I hated to have Robert part with
the picture anyway; he shan’t do it now for he’ll
never take pay for it!”</p>

<p>The judge looked blank, his hands trembled.
“But I wanted it!” he said plaintively, “I can’t
stand in the child’s light but—” he passed his
shaking hand over his forehead—“I shall miss
her terribly.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree nodded wisely without any sign
of relenting. “I know,” she said, “so shall I!
But Robert won’t take pay for the picture; I
fancy <i>you</i> selling a picture of the woman you
loved!”</p>

<p>The old man sighed profoundly, staring at the
floor, distinctly aware that she was tapping her
foot impatiently and eying him like an angry
sparrow, her head on one side. The silence was
painful, they both heard the bees in the trumpet
creeper which hung blooming over the bow-window.</p>

<p>After a while she stole a cautious amused look
at him, then she stirred eagerly in her chair.
“Stephen, I’ve just thought of a way! Robert
will, of course, keep the picture, but he’ll lend it
to you while Rose is away.”</p>

<p>Her manner was a trifle too elaborately casual,
but the judge did not observe it; a shamed look
of relief stole over his face, he passed his handkerchief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
across his brow, pushing back the scant
white hair. “And I can give it back as soon as
she comes home,” he said with almost an eager note
in his voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Allestree replied in a matter-of-fact
tone, stern business in her eye as she added:
“you’ll have to give it back at once, Stephen, and,
of course, you’ll be responsible for it while it’s
here. Now, you give that check to Rose, I want
to hear the child sing.”</p>

<p>The judge sighed profoundly, his head bowed.
“I’d rather be whipped, Jane,” he said brokenly,
“but the child has set her heart on it—and I’ve
shown myself an old fool!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree rose. “You have!” she said
uncompromisingly, “but then we’re both way behind
the times. In the first place you’ve only had
one wife and I’ve only had one husband! Margaret
White left for Omaha to-day; of course
she’ll be divorced and married to my nephew in half
an hour. I’ve some hope now of being fashionable,
if I can get a motor accident in the family! And
you’re broken hearted because your girl wants
to sing in public; tut, Stephen, you’re a hopeless
old fogy, go and marry Martha O’Neal!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was early in the following December before
Mrs. Allestree again came face to face with
the situation which was so intimately connected,
though in such different ways, with the
happiness of two members of her family, her son
and her nephew. The long months that had intervened,
however, had not dulled her remembrance
of that vivid scene in Margaret’s bedroom, or lessened
the degree of her secret sympathy—which
was in exact opposition to her judgment.</p>

<p>It was a long time indeed before she could recur
to that scene without a poignant feeling of guilt;
her conscience pinched her with self-righteousness;
she had found the mote in her sister’s eye
without seeing the beam in her own, she had judged
without experience. However, after awhile, this
sensitiveness was enveloped in a thicker moral coating,
and she began again to view the affair with
horror. The two little White children were constant
spectacles in the parks with their two French
nurses and their general air of bewildered desolation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
it was perfectly well known that Estelle had
raised a terrible outcry for her mother and refused
to be comforted, in spite of the conscientious
efforts of poor old Mrs. White who, whatever her
faults, was sincere in her devotion to the two poor
little waifs of wealth.</p>

<p>Mr. White, meanwhile, had created fresh scandal
by his open devotion to Lily Osborne, and would
probably have been still more outrageous if that
astute young woman had not judiciously absented
herself from the city at the very moment when society
had reached the limit of its endurance; but her
disappearance from the surface scarcely arrested
White’s downward career; he was plunging deeper
and deeper, and there were many rumors of scandals
connected with his administration which would
lead to his dismissal from the Cabinet. Some secret
information from the Navy Department had found
its way into the hands of a foreign government,
and the way of its passage through White’s
careless hands to Lily Osborne’s and from hers
to the representative of the foreign power was
unfortunately made altogether too plain to be ignored
except on the surface of things, to hush
scandal.</p>

<p>December found Washington a little aghast;
Congress had just re-assembled, Wicklow White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
had somewhat hastily resigned, almost on the date
which, in the previous year, had seen the retirement
of Wingfield, and one of the ambassadors had
been as hastily recalled, clearing the atmosphere
of an international situation with the accustomed
scapegoat! That the Cabinet would have to be
reorganized was evident, and Berkman’s prophecy
of eight months before was apparently on the eve
of fulfilment. The very atmosphere, surcharged
with excitement, seemed to breathe the name of
William Fox; only those who knew the secret of
Margaret’s divorce, which had just been granted
in Omaha, divined the fatal combination of circumstances.</p>

<p>Fox had been absent for months in his own state,
taking part in a campaign of unusual bitterness
and importance, and his remarkable powers of organization,
his keen policy, his magnetic eloquence,
had carried all before him. There had been, in
fact, a storm of applause; every newspaper in the
country had discussed him as a possible candidate
for the Presidency in the following year, his own
party with triumphant confidence, and the opposing
faction with reluctant admission of his great
strength. If anything had delayed his invitation
to take a seat in the Cabinet, it was openly hinted
to be the jealousy of the Administration and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
uncertainty whether such a position would conveniently
shelve him or increase his popularity.</p>

<p>To those who knew the whole truth Fox’s position
was almost tragic, but the man had returned
more than usually brilliant and untiring.</p>

<p>Rose had sailed for Europe in the previous June
in charge of an elderly cousin and Aunt Hannah,
and no one knew the secret of that parting or the
cost of it to Fox; no one indeed even surmised it
but old Mrs. Allestree.</p>

<p>The last six months had been trying ones to her
and she was meditating upon them, sitting before
the open fire in her drawing-room, her tea-table at
her elbow, waiting for Robert.</p>

<p>She measured the tea into the old Canton tea-pot,
she looked at the lamp under the kettle, and
then she turned back to her knitting, working fast
without looking at it, counting stitches now and
then and making an elaborate pattern with incredible
swiftness, her knitting needles flashing in
and out as the work slipped from one to the other
and back again. The glow of the fire played on
her face and showed the soft lines there, the alert
bright eyes, the snowy hair on the temples. The
clock struck six and she looked up expecting Robert,
but instead her parlormaid opened the door
to admit Mrs. O’Neal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Why, Martha, I’m delighted to see you! It’s
such a bitter evening I didn’t expect a call. Sit
down and have a cup of my tea.”</p>

<p>“I don’t take much tea now, I hear that it’s
bad for the complexion; but you can give me some
hot water and lemon, Jane,” replied her visitor,
seating herself with a rustle of silks and a rattle
of chains which made a distinct sensation in the
quiet room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree poured out the hot water and put
in the lemon. “I’m eighty-one,” she remarked,
with a queer little smile, “and I’ve rather forgotten
my complexion.”</p>

<p>“A mistake, my dear Jane,” replied Mrs.
O’Neal calmly, taking the steaming cup and slipping
back her sables; “I keep young by constant
attention to such details; I have my face
massaged every day, and even study my bonnets
and veils with that point in view.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree cast a covert glance at the vibrating
head under the large, flaring bonnet with
its cascade of ostrich feathers and said nothing,
instead she knitted violently.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve heard the news?” Mrs.
O’Neal remarked, after she had sipped the hot
water with a slightly wry face; “Margaret White
has returned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>Mrs. Allestree dropped a knitting needle.
“When?” she exclaimed rather hastily, while she
tried to recover the fugitive.</p>

<p>“Yesterday; she’s taken the apartment that
she had last spring.” Mrs. O’Neal mentioned
one of the more expensive but quiet apartment
houses; “have you any idea how much alimony
she got?”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, no!” exclaimed Mrs. Allestree;
“Gerty wrote me that White was disposed to be
very liberal, and he ought to be!”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Neal nodded. “He’ll marry Lily Osborne,
of course, and I shall cut them dead.”</p>

<p>“I should hope so!”</p>

<p>“Well, of course Lily’s footing was slippery
enough at the best and this passes endurance.
Mrs. Wingfield told me that it is absolutely certain
that she got money from Von Groten for some kind
of information; Lily has no conscience and she’s
only half an American, thank Heaven! Mrs.
Wingfield says she saw the check—”</p>

<p>“Martha, that woman will say anything!”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Neal shrugged her shoulders. “So does
everybody! If Margaret had only let her get into
society she wouldn’t have been so bitter now that
she’s got her chance; I often think that it pays
to be polite to these parvenus! I only hope Margaret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
doesn’t expect me to hold her up until this
blows over.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree smiled involuntarily. “I can’t
imagine Margaret in the light of a suppliant,”
she said quietly.</p>

<p>“A mere <i>façon de parler</i>, of course, on my
part,” Mrs. O’Neal retorted; “but, Jane, this is
all a bad business, it will have to be patched up,
but—” she set down her cup and looked earnestly
at Mrs. Allestree—“Jane, does she mean to
marry your nephew?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree dropped her knitting and held up
both hands. “Heaven knows, not I!” she replied;
“of course she can’t be in the fashion unless
she marries again.”</p>

<p>“But to marry Fox! That will create a perfect
<i>furore</i>. Did you know he’s been offered the portfolio
of State?”</p>

<p>A quiver of excitement passed over Mrs. Allestree’s
pale face. “Actually—or only metaphorically,
Martha?”</p>

<p>“Actually, to-day—I had it from two Cabinet
officers.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree’s hands fell on her knitting, and
she sat looking into the fire. What a nightmare
of a complication! To marry Margaret would
ruin him, yet not to marry her—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“It isn’t generally known yet that he may
marry Margaret; if he does—” Mrs. O’Neal held
up her hands this time, and her plumes trembled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it, Martha,”
Mrs. Allestree said judiciously.</p>

<p>Martha O’Neal looked at her shrewdly and
smiled, but she changed the subject as she gathered
up her furs again preparatory to departure.
“Lily Osborne is reported to have made twenty
thousand at bridge at the Hot Springs,” she observed
casually; “I wish I didn’t entertain an
awful doubt of her integrity.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allestree looked up weakly. “You can’t
mean she cheats at cards?”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Neal laughed. “She’d be caught at
that, my dear, and ostracized. She only happens
to know who to fleece, you can see how rich she
grows.”</p>

<p>“I heard; Gerty told me that Senator Turkman
had advised her judiciously in placing some
money in mining shares and there has been a rise;
Lily told her.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated Mrs. O’Neal, finally
catching the other end of her sable boa; “it’s
rather odd, isn’t it, that Senator Turkman didn’t
make any money for himself at the same time?
He’s terribly embarrassed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>Mrs. Allestree leaned back in her chair and
laughed silently. “Martha,” she said finally,
“you’re a sinner and a publican, let me alone! I
haven’t heard so much gossip in a year.”</p>

<p>“My dear Jane,” retorted the other woman
dryly, “you live under a hill.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the midst of these eddying swirls of gossip,
little muddy pools in the thin ice on which he
trod, William Fox made his way with singular
self-absorption. Even the vortex of the political
campaign had not succeeded in decentralizing his
thoughts, and he could not now lose sight of the
impending climax.</p>

<p>The clamor of applause, the proffered Cabinet
portfolio, which was not without significance as
an effort on the part of the Administration to bind
him to its interests and avert his candidacy in the
ensuing year, all fell short of their effect. Such
brilliant prospects were indeed stultified to his
mental vision by the chilling knowledge that he
must soon outrage the feelings of his friends and
reanimate his enemies. There were moments when
the future which lay before him loomed so black
and unfriendly that he could not endure the
thought, and he found it well nigh impossible to
picture himself playing the rôle of lover and husband
to the woman who had twice thwarted his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
life; first by her careless rejection of his love and
then by her determined demand upon his honor.
He should marry her, but beyond that bald fact
his mind refused to go. He had erred and he
would resolutely pay the cost and it would be
heavy. He realized that, realized the probable
collapse of his career, the long years of building
up which must follow, the impossibility of living
down the scandal of such a marriage under such
circumstances.</p>

<p>He knew that Margaret was in town, but he had
not yet gone to see her; it seemed impossible that
he should go. Yet the plain actualities of the case
could not be denied. He was aware, however, of a
feeling of keen thankfulness that the House, under
pressure of some special business, was sitting late,
and that the organization of committees and the
hundred other calls involved him in such a round
of duty that he could well excuse delay.</p>

<p>Yet when the House rose one day at five o’clock,
and he had time to go to see Margaret, he went
instead on foot to Allestree’s studio. He had seen
but little of his cousin in the past few months;
perhaps because he was haunted with a secret
dread that Rose would finally marry Allestree, and
he hated the thought, with all a lover’s selfishness.</p>

<p>The snow was falling fast and the streets were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
sheeted in white when he and Sandy approached
the old house on the corner, and he noticed that the
windows of Lerwick’s curiosity-shop were coated
thick with frost. A bright light in the upper window
assured him that the painter was still at work,
and stamping the snow from his feet he ascended
the narrow stair to the studio.</p>

<p>Allestree, in his shirt sleeves, was engaged in
putting away some old canvases and cleaning up
his workshop, and was somewhat startled by the
unexpected entrance of Sandy and his master.</p>

<p>“I hardly thought to find you here so late,”
Fox remarked as he greeted him, “but I saw the
light and came up.”</p>

<p>“I was house cleaning,” Allestree explained;
“I can’t trust the janitor in here until I put
things in shape. Besides, mother is away and
there’s no hurry about going home.”</p>

<p>Fox expressed surprise at his aunt’s absence at
this season, and Allestree explained further that
she had gone to Orange to visit a younger sister
who was ill there; a fact which the nephew of
both had forgotten.</p>

<p>“I’ve intended to go to see Aunt Jane every
day,” Fox remarked, seating himself on the end of
Allestree’s brass wood-box and looking at the general
disorder with an absent eye, “but I’ve been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
busy and—” he laughed bitterly—“she has let
me know pretty plainly that she doesn’t approve of
me.”</p>

<p>“A sure sign of her devotion,” retorted Allestree
dryly; “she is always taking sides when her
affections are involved. I’ve often thought you
were more after her own heart than I, William.”</p>

<p>“God help her, I hope not!” Fox exclaimed
with such abrupt passion that his cousin stared.</p>

<p>“I heard this morning that you had been offered
the State Department,” he said quietly; “are congratulations
in order?”</p>

<p>The other man laughed with great bitterness.
“My dear Robert,” he replied, “I’ve been offered
the moon, but being merely mundane I can’t pull
it down.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not sure that the Cabinet is even
desirable for you! I’ve known it to quietly swallow
up more than one bit of Presidential timber,”
Allestree observed, turning his attention to the
canvases he was tying together with unsteady
fingers.</p>

<p>“Desirable or not, I have refused it,” Fox said
curtly.</p>

<p>There was a pause; Allestree put away some
boxes and collected his scattered brushes. Fox,
looking about the studio with a moody glance, observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
that a curtain was drawn before the little
tea-table where Rose had made tea, and the chair
in which she had posed was gone. He was not at
a loss to understand these signs, and he recalled
the whole little scene, with its air of domesticity,
their gayety, the tender beauty of her drooping
profile as she bent over her tea-cups, he even remembered
how the light from the alcohol lamp
glowed softly on her face and caught the golden
tints in her hair. He stifled a groan. The whole
covetous passion of his soul had surged up at the
thought, and he was to see her married at last to
this good, harmless, slow cousin who was so worthy
of her because of his clean unspotted life and his
honest love! He glanced keenly at Allestree and
saw the haggard trouble of his face, the lines on
his brow and about his mouth, with almost a pang
of joy. There was no assurance of happiness here,
only a kindred trouble. The hard element of his
personal feeling melted a little, and he turned to
the painter with renewed friendliness. “You have
heard of the Temples?” he said guardedly; “is
the old man out of his troubles, and has Rose returned?”</p>

<p>Allestree shook his head, avoiding his eye. “The
judge is still in the quagmire; he was miserably
imposed upon and I fancy there is nothing left but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
his salary. He has been making gigantic efforts to
save that old house; you know it’s mortgaged, and
he seems ill and worn, though he goes regularly
to court.”</p>

<p>“Who holds the mortgage?” Fox asked absently.</p>

<p>Allestree named a large trust company, and began
an eager search behind his easels, apparently
excluding Rose from his reply. But Fox was not
done. “And his daughter?” he said, in a low
voice, caressing Sandy who had laid his head upon
his knee as a gentle reminder that it was time to
go.</p>

<p>“She is still in Paris; she wrote my mother
that she was succeeding very well with her lessons
and hoped for the best.” Allestree’s voice betrayed
his extreme reluctance to produce even
these hard facts.</p>

<p>Fox rose abruptly and going to the window
thrust aside the curtain and looked out. The
storm had increased and the street light opposite
shone behind a dazzling whirl of snow-flakes which
were swept before the wind and hurled themselves
against the pane in a wild rush of blinding white.</p>

<p>Fox turned away and began to walk to and fro,
his hands plunged into his pockets and his head
sunk on his breast. Allestree glancing at him once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
or twice was shocked by the drawn grayness of his
face, the absolute despair in his dark, deep-set
eyes. At last he looked up with a bitter smile.
“Good God!” he exclaimed abruptly, “if I were
only coward enough to shoot myself!”</p>

<p>“A very unprofitable move,” remarked his
cousin coldly, “and it leaves the blame to others.”</p>

<p>Fox nodded. “Precisely,” he said, “and to a
woman. But, my dear Allestree, if you want to
create a hell for a man, find one who loves a young
lovely untried girl with all his soul, and then force
him to marry another woman!”</p>

<p>His cousin bit his lip, the color rushing over his
face. “No easy matter, I fancy,” he said; “you
couldn’t make the man do it; he’d back out at
last!”</p>

<p>Fox gave him a strange look; he had never intended
to make such an admission to Allestree, it
had been wrung from him by the stress of his own
feeling and now he would not recall it. “You
think so? You think it cannot be done? The
shooting would be preferable,” he added grimly,
“but, unhappily, a man’s honor lives after him.”</p>

<p>His cousin turned sharply and held out his
hand; the gesture was involuntary. “Upon my
soul, William, I’m sorry for you!” he exclaimed,
with much feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Fox took his hand and wrung it. “You’ll make
her happy, Allestree!” he exclaimed with profound
emotion; “she’ll marry you.”</p>

<p>Allestree smiled sadly. “She’s refused me,” he
said, with a tone of finality which carried conviction
if not relief.</p>

<p>Fox turned away with a smothered groan, and
groping for his hat and coat went out without another
word.</p>

<p>At that moment the tumult of his heart repudiated
every other claim and demanded happiness
with an unscrupulous passion which excelled Margaret’s
own.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the following evening that Margaret
rose restlessly and looked out of the window
of her little hotel drawing-room. She knew
that the House had risen at five, she had telephoned
twice to ascertain that fact, and her note of the
morning should have brought Fox straight from
the Capitol.</p>

<p>It was now almost six o’clock, the streets were
lighted and thronged with people, some hurrying
home from office or shopping, others still on those
endless social rounds which had once been the orbit
of Margaret’s life. She thought of that existence
now, its brilliance, its flattery, its hollowness, with
a shudder. Between the two periods of her life
there was a chasm. It had been only a few months,
but those months had been years in her emotional
existence, and her stormy soul struggling through
the depths of it had worn away the body which
with her seemed but the beautiful ephemeral garment
of a wild spirit. When it was over, the
divorce with its hideous publicity, its sordid details,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
its piercing accusations, and freedom had
come to her with almost blinding reality, she had
declared that she should rebuild her life, forget all,
be happy—happy!</p>

<p>She had expected at once some message from
Fox, some sign of sympathy, but when none came
she interpreted his silence by her own heart; he
was loth, she thought, to show too much joy at
once. They could wait! How sweet it was to
think that once again they had their lives before
them; they were still young, the world had potent
possibilities of happiness for them. The sheer joy
of the thought drove the blood to her heart; she
could not breathe sometimes but lay panting, her
head thrown back on her pillows and her arms
flung wide and helpless, until Gerty came and with
trembling hand administered restoratives and
threw up the windows. They called them heart
attacks but it did not matter, nothing mattered
now; she would begin all over again. Her old life
had slipped from her, as though its shackles, having
been stricken off, had left no scar. She had
been in Washington a week, but she had not asked
to see her children; she could not, the thought of
them sent a shiver through her; they were the
visible and actual links which bound her to the
past, the past which her soul loathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>She had waited eagerly for Fox, aware that he
was in the city before her arrival, and when he did
not come she still attributed his absence to a reluctance
to be too soon to claim her. That he loved
her she never doubted, and her heart trembled at
the thought of that meeting which must come at
last, with all its sweetness, its fulfilment, after her
long waiting. That morning she had written him
and now she watched the clock, carelessly aware
that Gerty English was also watching it, and that
the girl seemed disconcerted and awkward with
her work over Margaret’s letters and books.</p>

<p>But to Margaret everything outside of that one
absorbing fact was of little moment; what Gerty
thought of no consequence at all, for while she had
made only half a confidante of the girl, turning to
her in uncontrollable moments and then relapsing
again into reserve, she was actually indifferent to
the nature and extent of Gerty’s knowledge; the
little secretary seemed to her as unimportant as
any other parasite upon the lives of the more fortunate.</p>

<p>Margaret went openly to the window therefore,
and drew aside the curtains to watch the long brilliantly
lighted street, where the snow lay yet in
white drifts between the muddy slush of traffic, and
she returned openly to the fire to look at the clock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
on the mantel. At first the delay had been almost
sweet, she liked to dwell upon the thought of seeing
him, of being happy again, but at last it grew
irksome and she paced nervously to and fro, her
hands clasped behind her head, scarcely vouchsafing
an answer to Gerty’s occasional questions.</p>

<p>Time passed; it was nearly half past six before
her maid came in to announce a visitor and Margaret
turned, hiding herself a little in the shadow
of the curtain that she might see him first when
he entered.</p>

<p>As the door finally opened to admit Fox, Gerty
English rose rather hastily and retreated to one
of the other rooms, with her arms full of books and
papers, and he found himself face to face at last
with Margaret.</p>

<p>There was an eloquent silence; he was painfully
aware of the change in her, that the delicate hollows
in her cheeks were sharpened while her eyes
seemed larger and more brilliant, and there was a
wistfulness, a soft tremulous happiness and expectation
in her expression which touched him to
the heart. She had never looked so young, so
fragile and so gentle since those old days when as
half child, half woman, he had loved her. That
dead love lying between them now made an impassable
barrier, she could as little rekindle it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
she could reclaim a fallen star. Some dim, half
interpreted perception of this chilled her heart
and stayed the passionate greeting on her lips;
she stood a moment looking at him, terribly aware
of the calmness of his bearing, his pallor, his dark
troubled eye which neither kindled nor blenched
at the sight of her, but met hers with a studied
gentleness which expressed neither joy nor reluctance.
A keen pang of dread tore her heart,
but the next instant joy, wild, almost childish joy
at the sight of him, welled up and swept away her
doubts.</p>

<p>“Oh, William!” she exclaimed with trembling
lips, holding out both hands, “at last, at last!
It has been eons since we met!”</p>

<p>“And you look ill,” he replied kindly, “Margaret,
I hoped to see you well again. How is
this?”</p>

<p>Her eyes sought his face, eager, feverish, questioning;
her heart trembled, was this all?—this
stilted, quiet, commonplace greeting? She checked
the cry of reproach which rose to her white lips,
and smiled—a wan and pallid smile. “I’m quite
well,” she replied with sudden calm; “you forget
the months have been long and troubled ones; I
suppose I grow old!”</p>

<p>“I never saw you look younger, more as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
used to look ten years ago,” he exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Do I?” there was a tremulous note of eagerness
in her voice, and a faint blush passed over her
face, but she evaded his hand, which he had
stretched out again to clasp hers, and went quietly
to a shaded corner where neither lamplight nor
firelight fell too sharply on her. “Sit down, William,
and tell me about yourself.”</p>

<p>He obeyed her mechanically, unconscious that
his manner had betrayed anything, but aware of
a sudden indefinable change in her, a restraint and
repression. “There is nothing to tell,” he said,
with some impatience; “the old story—primaries,
conventions, a stormy campaign and
finally, as you know, my re-election is assured, if
I care for it!” he added, a hard new note of indifference
in his voice.</p>

<p>She heard it and leaned forward a little on her
cushions, trying to read his face, studying every
fine and classic outline of the strong head, the
brow, the deep-set brilliant eye, the thin-lipped
sensitive mouth, the clean shaven, strong jaw and
chin. It was his face; how often she had dreamed
about it and dreamed of it as turned to her with
the glow of love and joy on it, but how pale it
was, how hard, how resolute!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“I knew the campaign was hotly contested, but
I never doubted your success,” she said simply;
“you know I always believed in you.”</p>

<p>He turned sharply and looked at her. “What
is the matter, Margaret? You are not yourself.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “No,” she admitted, looking at
him with an enigmatical expression, “no, I am not
myself; the old Margaret is dead—and buried!
Not even Mrs. Wingfield would know me; I burnt
up my last red hat yesterday, William.”</p>

<p>He answered her smile involuntarily, but his
eyes remained grave, almost stern. He turned
abruptly, holding out his hand. “Margaret,” he
said, “I came—of course you know it—to ask
you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>She drew a long breath and was silent, her eyes
on his face; she was wonderfully calm.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that the sooner it is over the
better for both of us,” he went on hurriedly;
“there will, of course, be some talk; we must face
it together.”</p>

<p>Without answering him she bent over and picked
up a half sheet of the morning newspaper from the
floor, and after glancing at it, held it out to him.
“There is an article there about you,” she said in
a low voice; “it says you have refused the State
Department; is that true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>He put the paper aside with a little impatience.
“Of course it’s true,” he said; “I refused it three
days ago.”</p>

<p>She was again silent for an instant while she
folded the paper into plaits. “Why did you refuse
it?” she asked.</p>

<p>Fox moved sharply and turned his face away,
looking at the fire. “That does not concern us,
Margaret,” he said gravely; “our marriage is the
only question now; I—”</p>

<p>She interrupted him. “Tell me,” she insisted,
“it’s my right to know; this had something to do
with me, with the prospect of—of your marrying
Wicklow’s divorced wife, I know it! Tell me the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Of what avail?” he retorted with evident reluctance,
his cheek red.</p>

<p>“I have a right to know,” she reiterated.</p>

<p>He smiled bitterly. “The situation is quite
clear, isn’t it? I can’t take White’s place in the
Cabinet and White’s wife; it would be monstrous.”</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair, shading her face
with her thin hand which trembled slightly, she
tried to speak, but her dry lips refused to move.
His manner, no less than his words, had ruthlessly
torn away the last shreds of her self-deception, and
her poor shivering soul shuddered at this revelation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
of the hardness in him, the eternal note of
egoism. How plain it was, how simple, how inexorable!
The man’s love had died, and hers had
fed itself upon a chimera, a phantasm of her
imagination, a dream of the past! Her hand
trembled so that she let it fall in her lap and
averted her face.</p>

<p>Something of the anguish she felt reached him;
he perceived her thought without knowing that he
had laid bare his heart to her, and he felt a pang
of remorse for his words, though she had wrung
them from him with a woman’s besotted madness, a
woman’s wild determination to probe her own
agony to the core.</p>

<p>“It is of no consequence to me, Margaret,” he
said kindly; “I shall give it all up and go away
with you; we must build it up from the beginning
again. Only it is best to have it over.”</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, looking into the fire which
had fallen from the andirons and lay in red coals
on the broad hearth. “Tell me,” she said
abruptly, turning her full gaze on him, “I have
been away and I do not know—where is Rose
Temple? Is she still in Paris?”</p>

<p>There was a striking change in his face as
though his features, made of potter’s clay, had
suddenly fixed themselves into the shape of a mask,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
stern and unchanging in its finality. “Yes, she’s
in Paris,” he replied, with strong reluctance to
speak of her; “I know nothing else. You can ask
Allestree.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then I suppose it will end happily at last,”
Margaret said softly; “she will marry Allestree;
I always thought so.”</p>

<p>Fox rose abruptly and walked to the fire, standing
a moment looking down at its fallen embers,
his back toward her. She could not see his face,
but in the covetous agony of her soul she needed
no sight, she knew! A gray shadow passed over
her own features, her eyes closed, she shivered from
head to foot.</p>

<p>After a moment of terrible silence he turned.
“When can we be married, Margaret?” he demanded,
with passionate haste; “it must be soon,
it cannot be too soon!”</p>

<p>She rose, looking slighter and more frail than
ever. “No, it cannot be too soon; I will decide,
I have no preparations to make,” she added, with
a little, mocking smile; “I’m sorry, William, I’ll
be but a sober bride; you should have married a
young girl and had a grand wedding with a flourish
of trumpets.”</p>

<p>“Which I hate,” he said bluntly, “as you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“As I know?” she laughed a little wildly; “I
have known very little! You must go now; I—I’m
not very strong yet, and the excitement—”</p>

<p>“Has been too much,” he said kindly, “I’ll
come again to-morrow—you can tell me then; it
can’t be too soon.”</p>

<p>“What an ardent lover!” she said, her lips
trembling, “I’m proud of you, William, you do
famously, I—I—” she broke off and suddenly
laying her thin white hands lightly on his
shoulders she kissed his cheek, turned, evaded his
touch, and bursting into uncontrollable weeping
ran from the room.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MARGARET, leaning a little on Gertrude
English, stopped her with a slight pressure
on her arm, and shading her eyes
with her free hand stood gazing down the long
vista of the sunlit avenue. A final recognition
of the contrast between realities and the dreams
which had changed and warped her life came upon
her with a shock which made familiar objects seem
strange and distorted. A shudder of anguish
shook her slight frame and stole the blood from
her lip; stripped at last of all illusions, facing the
immutable laws of life, she felt as though she had
been thrust out into the streets homeless, and
naked, and ashamed; a wrecked soul to wander
henceforth up and down on the face of the earth
and find no place. How strange, how different
from yesterday! The tremulous love, the hope half
justified, the unscrupulous, unflinching desire for
happiness—where were they? Gone, shrivelled,
dead! And she was not dreaming, she was wide
awake, this was life, life with its inexorable bonds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
its laws, its justice, its cruel requitals, all else had
been a dream! Happiness—what was it? A
phantom of some man’s imagination, the flaming
sword of the angel at the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>Before her lay the busy, beautiful thoroughfare,
alive with carriages and motor-cars, with gay
people, children, old women and perambulators.
The sun had already swept away all but a few
vestiges of snow; it was one of those spring days
which come to us in December. At her very feet
were some pansies blooming hardily. Away at the
north, between long rows of houses, across the intervening
circle, she saw the street ascending the
hill, caught the white outlines of the high buildings
on the heights, the deep blue of the sky.</p>

<p>Yesterday and to-day, oh, God!</p>

<p>She walked on, unconscious of the curious
glances which followed her slight, elegant figure,
her small pinched face under the great hat with
its toppling plumes; unaware, too, that women
leaned forward in passing carriages, looked eagerly
and sank back into the friendly shelter, glad
to escape the necessity of recognition until some
one should decide upon the proper course,—rehabilitation
or oblivion.</p>

<p>Gerty, shrewd and watchful, saw and made mental
notes. She decided swiftly who should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
struck off the list when Margaret’s star rose again;
no court chamberlain ever drew lines tighter than
she at that moment because, in her pity and her
affection, she resented every slight with bitter
zeal.</p>

<p>Margaret, meanwhile, walked on, regaining her
self control with an effort, her large, melancholy
eyes gazing dreamily ahead of her. “Gerty,” she
said at last, “do you suppose any one is ever really
happy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy, yes!” retorted that matter-of-fact
young woman, in great astonishment, “I am often!
There are so many nice things in the world, Margaret,
and when one has money—” Miss English
drew a long breath; it expressed her thought.</p>

<p>Margaret smiled bitterly. “Is that the sum
total, Gerty? Is there nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course, but not to have to pinch
and work and reason, just to be vulgarly downright
rich once! I shouldn’t ask much else,” said
Gerty ecstatically.</p>

<p>“You have no imagination, Gerty,” Margaret
replied, “that’s been my curse, I’ve imagined myself
into a fool’s paradise! As for money—I’ve
had it all my life, it never gave me anything I
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Margaret!” Miss English almost sobbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
“think of all you’ve had, of all you’ve got, of all
you’re going to have!” she added incoherently.</p>

<p>“Of all I’m going to have?” Margaret repeated,
with a strange smile; “my dear Gerty,
the prospect is certainly blinding. Thank you!”</p>

<p>Gerty stared. She did not understand, and she
dared not press the question; she could not but
perceive the cold agony in Margaret’s eye.</p>

<p>Their walk had brought them to a little triangle
between the streets, and as they crossed
above it, a child’s voice cried out after them with
a shrill little note of joy. “Oh, mamma, there’s
mamma!”</p>

<p>Gerty felt the hand on her arm tighten, and the
shiver which ran through the figure at her side
was almost as perceptible. They both turned and
looking across the grass-plot saw two French
nurses, a child in a carriage and Estelle running
toward them, her small face flushing with eagerness,
her pale hair streaming in the breeze. She
came swiftly, reached them and, with the first unchecked
impulse of her life, flung her arms around
her mother. “Mamma, mamma!” she cried,
“I’ve wanted you so much!”</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her strangely for a moment,
then her lips twitched and tears came into her eyes,
as she stooped down and clasped the child close.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
For the first time the instinct of maternity spoke;
she had seen, too, a strange vague likeness to herself
in the small, upturned face, one of those fleeting
glimpses that come in a look. “Did you really
want me, Estelle?” she asked gently, submitting
to the child’s wild joy with a new surprised tenderness.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, you’re coming home?” Estelle
sobbed, clinging to her; “you’re coming back to
us? Oh, where have you been, mamma?”</p>

<p>Margaret kissed her and rose, putting her off
a little; she saw that people were looking at them,
and a slow dull flush rose to her forehead. “Yes,
I’m coming,” she said with an effort; “I’ll—I’ll
come to-morrow, Estelle, and ask Grandmother
White to let me take you for a while. You must
be good, child; don’t cry, mamma can’t bear it!”</p>

<p>“Come now, mamma!” Estelle wailed, holding
her dress with desperate fingers and calling to her
little brother who still clung to his nurse, staring
as if he saw a stranger.</p>

<p>The two French women were huddled together,
not sure of their instructions and obviously
alarmed. Margaret looked over at them and
gently detached Estelle’s fingers from her draperies.
“I’ll come to-morrow,” she said more
firmly; “now run and play.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>But the child caught at her skirts again, still
sobbing; she had felt her mother’s arms about her,
and half the dread and fear of desertion which
had hung over her, half the talk of the nurses which
had frightened her, was swept away; she had a
mother. “Oh, mamma,” she sobbed, “take me
with you—I won’t make any noise!”</p>

<p>Margaret bent and kissed her again, her strange,
wild look almost frightening poor Gerty who stood
completely discomfited and at a loss, her honest
blue eyes full of tears. “There, there!” the mother
whispered, “I’m glad you love me, Estelle, I’m
coming, coming soon. Oh, Gerty, go home with
her!” she added suddenly, “take her away—I—I
can’t bear it!”</p>

<p>Gerty obeyed with a pale face. She bent down
and whispered to Estelle, kissed and cajoled and
threatened until the child let go her mother’s skirt
and began to cling to the girl whom she really
knew far more intimately, for the good-hearted
little secretary had spent many an hour in that
gloomy, magnificent nursery. Gerty’s hands shook
but she held the child, told her about some lovely
things she was going to bring her, a doll, a fairy-book,
a toy which ran about the floor of its own
accord.</p>

<p>In the midst of it Margaret turned and fled;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
she had not dared to go to the little boy, although,
quite unacquainted with his mother, he was merely
staring in a dull, infantile way, his finger in his
mouth, ready, no doubt, to raise a sympathetic
wail if his sister’s grief warranted a chorus.</p>

<p>The mother, whose rights in the children had
been settled by the courts at six months in the year
if she desired it, went on blindly along the sunny
avenue which seemed now to mock her with its
gayety. She turned sharply away from a crowded
circle into another street, hardly conscious where
she went, but bent upon escape, oblivion, silence.</p>

<p>The child’s cry had touched her chilled and
starving heart; she saw her life revealed; she had
thrust away the ties of nature, the demands of
natural love and duty in her mad pursuit of happiness;
she had lost all and gained nothing.</p>

<p>She put up a shaking hand and drew down her
veil; her lips were dry and parched, it was difficult
to breathe, she had to relax her pace. Another
corner brought her to an abrupt and horrified
pause. She came face to face with Mrs. O’Neal
at a moment when she felt that she could least
abide the sight of any one. But with the shock of
recognition her scattered senses recovered themselves,
her nerves vibrated again, she summoned
back her will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Margaret!” exclaimed the old lady, pausing,
with her skirts gathered up and her foot on her
carriage-step, just the shadow of surprised restraint
in her manner, the indefinable change
that greets the altered social scale; “I’m—I’m
delighted to see you! And how are you, my
dear?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Margaret replied, with an odd little
laugh, for her quick ear had caught the note;
“don’t I look so?”</p>

<p>The bird of paradise on Mrs. O’Neal’s hat
trembled. “No,” she said flatly, “you don’t; you
need building up, you should go to the country for
awhile. I’m due at bridge now or I should make
you get in and drive with me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I couldn’t,” Margaret replied,
with forced calm; “I wish you luck at cards instead.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Neal glanced at her coachman, stiff and
expressionless upon the box, then she leaned over
and put a gentle hand on the younger woman’s
arm. “My dear, I congratulate you,” she murmured,
“you’re lucky to be free; I was so shocked
to read this morning that Mr. White had married
Lily Osborne yesterday.”</p>

<p>Margaret suppressed her start of surprise.
“Has he?” she said, “I forgot to read the paper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
and Gerty misses everything except the ninety-eight
cent bargains.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday—in New York!” said Mrs.
O’Neal tragically; “I hope you’ve got the children.”</p>

<p>Margaret quietly withdrew her arm. “Thanks,
yes,” she said; “I’m afraid you’ll be late for your
bridge.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As she walked on, her heart sank. Lily Osborne—of
course she had known it would be so! But
if anything happened to her and Mrs. White died—poor
Estelle!</p>

<p>The cry of the child pursued her. Until now
she had thought only of herself, of her own misery,
but the touch, the voice of the little girl had
reached her very soul; after lying dormant and
unknown all those years it was awakening, awakening
to a reality so dreadful that it was appalled,
without hope, desolate. And shame, the shame of
a woman’s heart swept over her and shook her being
to its depths. The humiliation which comes
upon a woman when she knows, by some overwhelming
perception, that her love is not fully returned;
she felt as if she had stripped her soul
naked and left it lying in the dust at Fox’s feet.</p>

<p>She walked on; agony winged her feet and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
could not be still; she avoided the places which she
knew, and turned down strange streets and byways.
She had no thought of time. It grew late,
the short winter day drew to its close; still she
walked on. While her strength endured she went
on,—it seemed as if pursuing fate drove her.
She was not physically strong, yet she was walking
beyond the endurance of most women.</p>

<p>As the twilight gathered and the lights began
to start up here and there, she turned, with a dim
realization of her unfamiliar surroundings and her
sudden complete exhaustion. It was St. Thomas’
Day, four days to Christmas; she had no recognition
of it, but, looking up, her eye caught the
lighted vestibule of a church, and she saw some
women going in to vespers; an impulse made her
follow them. The heavy doors swung easily inward,
and conscious only of the shelter, the chance
for rest, a moment to collect her thoughts, she
passed in.</p>

<p>The service was nearly concluded, but she paid
no heed to that; moving quietly across the aisle
and finding a dark corner, she sat down wearily,
and crossing her arms upon the back of the pew
in front of her hid her face upon them. Mere
physical weariness had brought a dull relief to the
gnawing pain at her heart; it clouded her brain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
too, as weariness sometimes does, and she found the
horrible vivid thoughts which had tormented her
slipping softly away into a haze of forgetfulness;
her mind seemed a mere blur.</p>

<p>The soft organ tones swelling through the dim
church harmonized with her mood; she lost herself,
lost the agony of those past hours, and rested
there, inert, helpless, without power to think. She
was scarcely conscious of what passed around her,
her throbbing head felt heavy on her slender arms,
and she listened, in a vague way, to the music,
aware at last of a stillness, then the rustle and stir
of people settling themselves back in the long
pews. She stirred herself, turning her face upon
her arms.</p>

<p>A voice penetrated the stillness, a voice with
that vibrant quality of youth and passionate self-confidence.</p>

<p>“‘<i>The wages of sin is death!</i>’”</p>

<p>Margaret started and raised her head. Her
eyes, blinded by the sudden light in the chancel,
flickered a moment and she passed her hand across
them; at last she saw quite plainly a young strong
face, with a tense eager look, white against the
dark finishings of the pulpit; she caught the dazzling
white of his surplice, the vivid scarlet of the
hood which showed on his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“‘<i>The wages of sin is death!</i>’” He repeated
it, giving out his text in a voice which was resonant
with feeling.</p>

<p>Margaret sat back in her corner, gazing at him
with fixed, helpless eyes, her very soul dazed under
the force of revelation which was coming to her
swiftly, overwhelmingly. The revelation of her
own life, not of God. As yet she framed no
thought of that awful Presence, found no interpretation
of the tumult in her own soul, but she
knew, at last, that she had sinned. Sinned against
herself, her womanhood, her honor, her self-respect,
sinned against the man she had married, against
the children she had borne, and, at last—oh, God!—against
the man she loved.</p>

<p><i>The wages of sin is death.</i></p>

<p>She rose, rose with an effort of will for her knees
shook under her, and drawing herself together,
summoning all her strength and her pride to hide
the agony which was devouring her heart, she drew
down her veil and slipped out unnoticed, silent, like
a shadow. Once at the door, beyond the ring of
that terrible young voice, she paused and steadied
herself by laying her hand on a pillar of the portico.</p>

<p>It was now very dark; the electric lights at the
corner only made the space where she stood more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
shadowy and secure; the air was chill, damp, penetrating,
and she shivered. A horrible sense of
homelessness and misery swept over her; she had
cast herself out of a home, she had deserted her
children for the love of a man who—oh, God!—who
loved her not. She who had dreamed of happiness,
lived for it, fought for it, sinned for it,
who would have purchased it at the cost of heaven
itself, had found at last, not happiness but her own
soul.</p>

<p><i>The wages of sin is death!</i></p>

<p>She wrung her hands in silent agony; was there
no escape? She had no belief but, at last, she felt
that the very devils believed and trembled. Was
not God pursuing her with vengeance? Who else?</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT last the tumult of passion subsided and
Margaret, still leaning on the pillar of the
church portico, looked out with bewildered
eyes. Again an overwhelming weakness swept over
her and wiped out some of the vivid misery.</p>

<p>She must go home—home! The word brought
a dull pang of anguish, she had no right to a home,
for she had broken up her own and orphaned her
children. She closed her eyes, trying to shut out
the thoughts which stormed back, at a word, to
assault her poor fagged brain again. Then the
soft sweet notes of the recessional came out to her
and she knew that in a few moments the dispersing
congregation would find her there; summoning all
her flagging energies she stepped down into the
street and turning westward was suddenly apprised
of the fact that she had been in the old church so
often visible from the windows of Allestree’s studio.
The discovery brought her a feeling of relief; she
was near the studio and she could go there and
telephone for a cab to take her back to the hotel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
Losing herself in the shadows of the darkest side
of the poorly lighted street, she hurried toward
the old building on the corner and saw, with relief,
the light still shining in Allestree’s window as
well as in the curiosity-shop below.</p>

<p>She crossed the street and trying the side door
found the latch down. In another moment she
was toiling wearily up the old stairs, clinging to
the balustrade with an absolute need of its support.</p>

<p>To her surprise the studio was empty; she called
to Allestree, supposing him to be, perhaps, in his
storeroom above, but there was no answer and she
sank down in the nearest chair, too weary and helpless
to frame her thoughts. An open fire was burning
low on the hearth, and a half smoked cigarette
lay on the mantel edge. He had evidently gone
out for a moment and would soon return. Margaret
roused herself and looked about her with a
wretched feeling of strangeness and separation
from her own life. She seemed suddenly detached,
a mere onlooker where once she had been the centre
of the stage. There had stood the portrait of her,
and there the picture of Rose; both were gone!
She even noticed that the little tea-table was
pushed away, and divined Allestree’s secret feeling.
She knew every detail of the room, the tapestries,
the worn Turkey rug, Robert’s old cigarette-case.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
It was intolerable; she rose, and going to the
table, where the telephone stood, saw Allestree’s
portfolio and the pen and ink. She would leave a
line to explain her visit before she called a cab, and
she opened the portfolio to look for a scrap of
paper; as she did so her eye fell on the page of a
letter written in old Mrs. Allestree’s clear hand;
unconsciously she read the lines before her:</p>

<p>“Margaret has broken up Fox’s happiness
twice, once when she broke her own engagement to
him, and now in separating him from Rose—”</p>

<p>She closed the book sharply, suddenly aware of
what she did and deeply shamed by it, but the
thought of the personal dishonesty of her heedless
act was lost in the sharper pang of realization;
she saw at last the light in which her actions had
appeared to others. She stood still, her face
frozen, and a cry sprang to her lips from the
depths of hidden passion, the cry of some mortally
wounded wild creature who faces death alone. She
knew it, she did not need to be told it, but others
knew it too! It was the bitter drop in her cup of
gall; the wild anguish which swept away all other
realities, even the desire for life, amazed her. For
one moment she hated Rose with all the strength
of her undisciplined soul, the next a great wave of
humiliation submerged her being. She turned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
forgetting the telephone, forgetting everything
but a desire to escape the meeting with Allestree,
groped her way to the door like a blind
woman and went down stairs. At the foot she
hesitated; a step in the street made her fear
to meet Robert at the door, and she turned and
plunged into the curiosity-shop. She found herself
behind the chintz curtain, in the place which
evidently served as a living-room for Daddy Lerwick,
and she saw a table spread for supper, while
the scent of garlic streamed from a pot on the
stove. Hurrying across the room she lifted the
curtain and entered the shop.</p>

<p>Daddy Lerwick was leaning on the counter talking
to a young girl and passing a necklace back
and forth in his fat hands. At the sound of Margaret’s
step they both turned and looked at her
in surprise, a surprise which gave place on his part
to servile courtesy. But Margaret scarcely noticed
him; instead she saw the pale, worn face of
the girl, the pinched misery of her look as she
glanced at the stones in Lerwick’s coarse fingers.
Margaret’s eyes following hers, lighted, too, on the
jewels; it was a topaz necklace, the mate to the
bracelet which she had prized so long ago. The intuition
of misery, the sixth sense of the soul which—no
longer atrophied with selfishness—had suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
awakened within her, divined the secret. She
read the suspended bargain in Lerwick’s eye, the
hopeless anguish in the girl’s. It was only an instant;
the thought came to her like the opening of
a dungeon door on the glare of midday. Then she
drew back to avoid an encounter with two more
customers who had entered the shop and who began
at once to ask the prices of the objects in the windows.
Lerwick went forward to answer them; the
girl leaned on the counter, hiding her face in her
hands; a shiver of misery passed over her and
Margaret saw it. Moved by an impulse, as inexplicable
as it was unnatural, she touched the
shabby sleeve. “What is the matter?” she asked
softly.</p>

<p>The young woman looked up startled, but only
for an instant, the next the dull misery of her look
closed over her face like a mask, though her lip
trembled. “He’s offered me fifteen dollars,” she
faltered; “I—I suppose I’ll have to take it.”</p>

<p>Margaret quietly put out her hand. “Will you
sell it to me?” she said; “I will give more and
you will not have to give your name.”</p>

<p>The girl’s cheek crimsoned; she hesitated and
gathered the necklace into her hands; the gesture
was pathetic, it bespoke the actual pang of parting
with an old keepsake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>Margaret saw it. “Come, come with me,” she
said and led her back through the door to the
studio entrance; she no longer feared to meet
Allestree; a new impulse stirred her heart.</p>

<p>Under the light there she opened her purse and
hastily counted her money, she had a little over a
hundred dollars in small bills. Hurriedly thrusting
a dollar or two back into her pocketbook, she
pressed the remainder into her companion’s hands,
saying at the same time: “Keep your necklace,
I do not want it; I only wished to help you save
it.”</p>

<p>The young stranger looked at her in dull amazement,
stunned by the incomprehensible sympathy
and generosity when she had long since ceased to
look for either. She drew a long shuddering
breath. “Oh, I can’t take so much!” she gasped
out, “you—you must keep the necklace!”</p>

<p>Margaret regarded her sadly. “Child,” she
replied, “I’m more unhappy than you are; I do
not want either the money or the necklace; keep
them both!”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean it?” the girl whispered,
her eyes fastened on the face opposite in absolute
wonder and doubt; “you really mean to give me
all this—and you want nothing?”</p>

<p>Margaret smiled with stiff lips. “Nothing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>The pinched, childlike features of the stranger
quivered; it seemed as if the frozen sensibilities
were melting under this touch of common humanity.
Suddenly she burst into an agony of tears,
slipping down upon the stairs, her slender shabby
figure racked with sobs. “He heard me!” she
cried, “there is a God!”</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her strangely. “Do you
think so?” she asked vaguely, with parched lips,
“do you believe in God?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the girl cried, clasping her hands, “I
prayed—oh, God, how I prayed! It seemed as
if He didn’t hear me, no help came and I couldn’t
pay; I couldn’t pay, and they didn’t believe me
any more because I’d failed—you don’t know,
you’ve never failed like that! I thought God
didn’t care, that He had forgotten—but now—”
she rose from her knees, her face still wet with
tears but singularly changed, “I shan’t have to
do it!” she cried, “here’s enough to begin all
over again, I can go on, I’m saved! He heard!
Don’t you believe it? Don’t you see it must be
so?” she persisted, unconsciously catching at
Margaret’s draperies and her thin toil-worn hand
closing on their richness.</p>

<p>“For you, yes,” the older woman replied slowly;
“good heavens, I never knew how much money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
meant before!” she murmured, passing her hand
over her eyes again, “and you think—God heard
you—<i>God?</i>”</p>

<p>“He sent you!” the girl cried, exultantly,
wildly happy; “oh, yes, I’m sure of it—oh, God
bless you!”</p>

<p>A strange expression passed over Margaret’s
face. She leaned back against the wall, pressing
her hand to her heart. Then, as the girl still
sobbed softly, she touched her shoulder. “Open
the door,” she said quietly, “I—I must go, can
you help me? I’m a little dizzy.”</p>

<p>The young woman sprang to her and put out
her arm eagerly. “Let me help you; oh, I’d do
anything for you!”</p>

<p>Margaret smiled, a wan little smile that made
her haggard brilliant face weirdly sad. “It is
nothing. There, the air from the outside makes
me well again, this place is choking!”</p>

<p>The stranger walked with her to the corner,
eager to help her, to call a cab, to put her on the
cars, but as Margaret’s faintness passed she refused,
putting aside her protests with firm dismissal.
“No, no, I can go home,” she said bravely;
“good-bye, I’m glad I could help you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me go with you, let me do something!”
the girl appealed to her eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>But Margaret dismissed her and they parted,
the young stranger hurrying away down a narrow
by-street while her benefactress walked slowly
toward the nearest avenue. But she had gone only
a few steps when she turned and looked after the
shabby figure, which was only a short distance
from her. A vivid recollection of that cry that
God had heard her prayer, the absolute conviction
of it, swept over the stricken woman, and moved
by an impulse which she did not pause to question,
Margaret ran after the girl through the gathering
mist and overtook her, breathless. She turned
with a frightened look, full of dread, no doubt,
that she must yet give up the miraculously acquired
wealth, and she started when Margaret laid
a thin, ungloved hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask you,” she began,—and then
changed the sentence swiftly into a command,—“pray
for me to-night! You believe there is
a God—perhaps He’ll hear you again!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will!” the girl cried, bewildered;
“oh, I wish—”</p>

<p>But the unfinished speech was lost; Margaret
had turned and swiftly disappeared again into the
folds of the mist; like a shadow the girl saw her
vanishing into deeper shadows; something uncanny
and marvellous seemed to lurk in the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
thought of her beautiful haggard face, the wildness
of her smile, and the young woman hurried
away, hugging her treasure close, almost persuaded
that she had talked face to face with a being from
another world.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AVOIDING the crowded thoroughfares, and
no longer remembering her physical weariness
or that she had walked for hours without
food or drink, Margaret hurried on.</p>

<p>She had thought of death, and the means to
attain it most swiftly and easily, but as she passed
the brilliantly lighted chemist’s window, with its
arch hung with bright red Christmas bells, she put
away the thought; it was too cheap and sensational
and, after all, if there really were a God
could she take that swift, shuddering plunge
through the blackness of death to meet Him? <i>The
wages of sin is death!</i> It thundered in her ears,
making God the avenging Deity of the Old Testament,
for how little do those who preach sometimes
divine the pictures which they frame of
Him who was lifted up, as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, that all men might be
saved!</p>

<p>A strange new light began to come into Margaret’s
soul, and against it her thoughts took on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
dark and sharply outlined forms like the shadows
thrown on a white screen by the stereopticon; she
began to understand. Happiness, after all, was
a dream, an imagination, a word; it came not from
any visible cause, but lay hidden in every man’s
heart like hope imprisoned in Pandora’s box. The
secret of it came to her at last,—life moved in an
orbit; the past held the future, the future the
past, the present was but the connecting link in
the inexorable circle, it could not be broken while
memory existed, while a reckoning was required.
She could no more break the links with her past
than she could destroy her immortal soul.</p>

<p>In her heart a new, secret thought, born of the
strange girl’s gratitude, moved her out of herself.
She remembered Mrs. Allestree’s words, and her
love for Fox suddenly purged itself of its passionate
agony, its jealousy, its pain. Like a woman
in a dream she found her way at last to the hotel
and climbed the stairs. Her face bore too terrible
signs of anguish, and she shrank from the elevator
and the curious stare of the servants. It was the
dinner hour and the corridors were deserted. She
went quietly to her own room and did not ring for
her maid. She noticed that her evening gown had
been put out and the fire tended. Gerty was not
there, she would scarcely be there before nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
o’clock, and Margaret went to her desk and sat
down and began to write in feverish haste; if she
delayed, if she stopped to think she might never
do it and she was determined. She bent to her
task, white lipped and haggard, writing page after
page to Rose Temple. She poured out her heart;
in righting Fox she scarcely thought of herself,
except that she should never see him again, that
Rose must and should marry him! For abruptly
the divine impulse of self-immolation had been born
in the midst of the tumult of her soul; a woman’s
heart, like a eucalyptus tree, trembles with the
remembrance of anguish and the eternal sacrifice
of love.</p>

<p>As she finished it the clock struck and she looked
up startled; it was eight o’clock; she had been
out more than four hours. She sealed her letter,
stamped it and rose. For a moment her strength
failed her and she stood irresolute, but she was unwilling
to trust another hand, and she opened the
door and took Rose’s letter down to the post herself,
avoiding the elevator again. After she had
dropped it in the letter-box in the lower hall, she
climbed the long flight wearily to her room. The
fearful energy of the last few hours dropped from
her like a cloak, the effort was too much and she
felt an overpowering weakness, a sinking sensation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
she had had such moments before and the doctor
had furnished her with some restoratives with a
grim injunction to avoid tiring herself. A vision
of his grave face flashed across her now and
warned her. With the sudden ineffable sinking
and yielding, which came over her like a cloud and
seemed to drop her slowly, softly into space, was
born a keen desire to live; Estelle’s voice pierced
her memory like a knife; she seemed to hear that
plaintive cry—“Mamma, mamma, come home!”</p>

<p>She made one more supreme effort to reach the
medicines and was, indeed, but a few yards from
the cabinet which held them when her strength
yielded to that awful dark cloud which seemed to
be pressing down upon her, pushing her lower and
lower into the depths of silence. She slipped like
water to the floor, her head upon her outstretched
arms, a faint shudder ran through her; she was
dimly conscious of sinking down, down into a black,
fathomless abyss. Again Estelle’s voice quivered
through the clouds and mists and reached her
heart; she tried to struggle back, up through
vague distances, to answer it, but the mists grew
thicker; she heard it once again, no more! The
soft, ineffable clouds pressed closer, enfolded her;
she sank lower, floated off over the edge of space
and lost even thought itself.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR three days Fox had been under an almost
unbearable strain. Before and after speaking
to Margaret of their marriage he had
plunged in the same agonizing struggle with himself.
What diabolical power had been at work to
ruin his life, to frustrate his ambitions? The
strong egotism of his nature was aroused in all its
absorbing passion. On every hand he saw disaster;
he had builded well in all respects but one;
in that he had miserably failed, and behold the inevitable
result! Like Margaret herself, he saw
clearly at last; if he had kept away from her, if
he had broken from the spell of her fascination and
remained out of reach, this would never have been;
he had no one to thank but himself. It is usually
so; when we get down to the fundamental principles
we have ourselves to blame for the fall of the
Tower of Siloam.</p>

<p>As he faced the immediate prospect of marriage
with another woman, he realized the strength and
hopelessness of his love for Rose. To think of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
even in the same moment with Margaret was abhorrent
to him; he did poor Margaret scant justice
at such times, and the vivid realities of her
newspaper celebrity was a scourge to his sensitive
pride. For these things he must give up all, he
must pay the price. He who crossed his path when
this mood was on him was unfortunate,—Fox was
not a man to spare. His cruel irony, his poignant
wit had never been more feared on the floor of the
House than they were in those few days before
Christmas.</p>

<p>The day after his decisive interview with Margaret
he was late at the Capitol, lingering in his
committee-room after the others had left. On his
way home he dined at the club and was detained
there by some out-of-town friends until nearly
eleven o’clock. When he finally left the building
he started home on foot, and even stopped at a
news-stand to buy some papers and magazines. It
was twelve o’clock when he went up to his rooms,
and he was startled as he walked down the corridor
to see his door open and the vestibule lighted.
Sandy came to meet him with the air a dog wears
who knows that a friend is waiting for his
master.</p>

<p>Allestree was sitting by the table in the study,
and as Fox entered he rose with a sober face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
“I’ve been waiting for you for an hour,” he said;
“I have bad news.”</p>

<p>Fox stopped abruptly, his thoughts leaping instantly
to Rose. “Bad news?” he repeated in a
strange voice.</p>

<p>Allestree met his eye, perhaps read his thoughts.
“Yes, the worst,” he replied; “Margaret is dead.”</p>

<p>“Margaret?” Fox dropped the papers he
held, on the table, and looked at him, bewildered;
“impossible!”</p>

<p>“I wish it were so,” Allestree said quietly, hurrying
on with his disagreeable task; “it seems
that she was out to-day for a long time alone; no
one apparently knows much about it except the
elevator boy and he says she was away from the
hotel four hours or more. As nearly as we know
she was on foot and in the streets most of that
time. I know she was in my studio while I was
out;” he colored as he spoke; he had found his
mother’s letter on the floor and piecing the facts
together had divined much. “She came home
alone, went to her rooms and was found there later,
unconscious, on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Good God, where was Gerty?” Fox exclaimed,
with a gesture of horror.</p>

<p>“Margaret had sent her to Mrs. White with
Estelle; there was some painful scene in the street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
with the child—” Allestree stopped an instant
and then meeting his cousin’s eye he hurried on—“when
Gerty finally got to the hotel and found
her it was too late; the doctors say that if help
had been at hand she might have been saved. As
it was she never regained consciousness. Gerty
telephoned to my mother, but she will not be back
until to-morrow morning; when I got there Margaret
was gone.”</p>

<p>Fox sank into a chair by the table, and propping
his head on his hands stared blankly at a sheet of
paper before him. “Why was I not told?” he
demanded hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Gerty tried to get you, both at the Capitol
and here, but we could not find you.”</p>

<p>“I was at the club,” Fox exclaimed and then:
“Merciful heaven, Allestree, how terrible, how
harrowing! How impossible to realize!”</p>

<p>Allestree looked at him thoughtfully. “Do you
think so?” he said, “it has seemed to me for
more than a year that I saw death in her face; she
had, poor girl, a face of tragedy.”</p>

<p>Fox groaned, covering his own face with his
hands. His anger against her of a moment before
smote him with horrible reproach. Living, he had
ceased to love her, dead, she seemed suddenly to fill
his life to the exclusion of all else; she came to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
again in the guise of her thoughtless, happy, inconsequent
youth which had forged the links between
them. He rose and began to walk the floor,
his pale face distorted with passion. “My God!”
he cried suddenly; “I—Allestree, is it possible
that she divined the truth? That she knew me for
what I was, a sham, a mockery, a whited sepulchre?”</p>

<p>Knowing him and the unhappy woman, whose
love for him had wrecked her life, Allestree knew
too much to speak; he was silent.</p>

<p>The storm of his cousin’s passion rose and beat
itself against the inevitable refusal of death. Poor
Margaret! a few hours ago she had held the power
to ruin his career, now she had slipped quietly away
from him into the great Silence; the mute appeal
of her unhappy love touched his very soul as it had
never touched it in life; the impossibility of laying
the blame for life’s miseries on the dead came to him
with overwhelming force, and she, who a moment
before had been guilty, in his thoughts, of embarrassing
his future and blighting his life, became
suddenly the victim of his vanity, his idle pleasure
seeking which she had mistaken for love. He remembered,
with sudden horror and self loathing,
his coldness, his bitterness toward her, and the
manner in which she had received his proposal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
marriage. A swift electrifying realization of the
scene tore away his selfish absorption; his manner
of asking her had been almost an insult to her high
spirited pride, to her love, which had humiliated
itself by the first confession on that night in the
deserted ballroom where she had poured out the
wretchedness of her soul. She had come to him
wounded, homeless, and he had all but cast her
off in his passionate selfishness, his hatred of the
loveless marriage which his honor had bound him
to make.</p>

<p>If he had only loved her, if he had but dissembled
and seemed to love her! Overwhelmed with grief
he searched his mind for one reassuring recollection,
for one instance which should acquit him of
complicity in the tragic agony of her death, but he
found none. He had neglected her, denied her,
tried to evade that final moment when he must ask
her to be his wife, and through all she had borne
with him with a sweetness unusual in her stormy
nature; she had loved him well enough to make
allowances, to forgive, to overlook! And now passing
away from him without a word, she had left
only her final kiss of forgiveness on his cheek, the
wild rush of her tears at their last parting. Henceforth
he should never speak to her again, never
hear her voice, never know how deeply she had suffered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
never ask her forgiveness. The fact that
the sequence of events was inevitable, that a woman
no sooner seeks a man’s love than she loses it, gave
him no relief. In his own eyes he had been little
short of a monster of cruelty to a dying woman
because, forsooth, he loved another—younger and
more beautiful!</p>

<p>Memory, too, tormented him with the thought
of Margaret, young, sweet, confiding as she had
been when he had first known her and loved her; he
thought less of the moment when she broke faith
and married White; her fault was less now than
his; the error of a beautiful, wilful girl seemed
but a little thing before the awful fact of her
wrecked life, her tragic death. Through all she
had really loved him, that one thing seemed certain;
her spirit in all its wild sweet waywardness
had held to this one tie, her love for him, and when
she had turned to him at last in her wretchedness
seeking happiness, asking it, pleading for it like
a child, she had received not bread but a stone! He
knew now that no living woman could have misunderstood
his coldness, his tardiness, his indifference,
and in his cousin’s pale and averted face
he read an accusing understanding.</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair again and sat
staring gloomily at the floor. “What madness!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
he exclaimed at last, with sudden fury; “how
dared Gerty neglect her so? She was ill, weak,
unprotected!”</p>

<p>“Gerty was no more to blame than others,”
Allestree observed quietly.</p>

<p>Fox threw back his head haughtily, and their
eyes met. “I was willing to give her my life,” he
said bitterly, “I had no more to give!”</p>

<p>Allestree rose. “It is over,” he replied gravely;
“we cannot bring her back; come, you will go
there, she would wish it, I know,” he added, “and
there is no one else!”</p>

<p>The awful finality of those words and the reproach
they carried was indisputable. Fox rose
with a deep groan and went out with him, without
a word, to face the greatest trial of all.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN a little <i>pension</i> on the rue Neuve des Petits
Champs, Rose Temple had been working patiently
at her music for six months and more,
studying under one of the great Italian teachers,
a man who had trained more than one prima donna
and was, therefore, chary of his encouragement.
The enthusiasm which she had brought to her task
having been gradually dispelled by sharp disappointments,
she had struggled on, determined to
succeed at last.</p>

<p>The first test of her voice before the maestro and
his French critics had been a failure, a failure so
complete that she came home to weep her heart out
on the faithful shoulder of the elderly cousin who
was her chaperon and comforter. The weakness of
a voice, beautiful but not yet fully trained, her
trepidation at singing before the maestro and his
assembled judges, together with the long strain
of preparation, had united in her undoing. She
came back to the <i>pension</i> without a word of encouragement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
feeling at heart that she would never
sing a note again.</p>

<p>She sat down, laying her head on the little writing-table,
amid a wild confusion of Miss Emily
Carter’s pens and papers, and gave way to her despair.
“I shall never sing again!” she said,
“never—I’m a miserable failure; I haven’t any
more voice than a sparrow, and there’s all that
money wasted, thrown away!”</p>

<p>Miss Emily eyed her quietly. She had the intense
family pride which is nurtured in the State
of Virginia; she did not need to be told, she knew
that Rose had the loveliest voice in the world. As
for these nasty, little, fat, insinuating Frenchmen!
She took off her spectacles and smoothed her hair
back from her temples; it was done as they did
hair forty years ago; it matched her immaculate
turn-over lace collar and hair brooch. “You’ll
blot my letter, Rose,” she said calmly, with a little
drawl that was inimitable; “I don’t see what you’re
crying about, it will make your nose red; as for
these horrid little Parisians, they know about as
much about you as they do about heaven—which
isn’t enough to get there!”</p>

<p>In spite of herself Rose laughed feebly. “You’re
the most prejudiced person I know, Cousin
Emily!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“Prejudiced?” Miss Carter’s nostrils quivered
scornfully, “I wasn’t raised within forty miles of
Richmond for nothing, Rose Temple! Don’t you
suppose I know a gentleman when I see one? What
in the world can you expect from that person if he
is a singing master? He wears a solitaire ring on
his little finger and a red necktie. I reckon I’ve
got eyes if I do wear spectacles.”</p>

<p>“But he’s trained half the great singers of
the world, Cousin Emily, and at first he was so
kind about my voice—to-day—” Rose winked
back the hot tears—“to-day he never said a
word!”</p>

<p>“Pig!” ejaculated Miss Carter unmoved.</p>

<p>Rose laughed hysterically. “I shall never sing;
I’d better take to washing and ironing for a living!”</p>

<p>“You’d make a fortune,” retorted Miss Carter
ironically; “while you were mooning you’d scorch
all the shirt bosoms and smash the collars.”</p>

<p>“You’re not a bit encouraging; no one is!”
Rose said helplessly, leaning back in her chair; “it
makes my heart ache to think of wasting poor
father’s money so!”</p>

<p>“And I reckon he’d give the whole of it to keep
your little finger from hurting; he thinks you’re
a chip of the moon. And how in the world do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
know you’ve wasted it yet?” continued her cousin,
calmly indignant; “perhaps you didn’t sing well
to-day; is that any reason you won’t to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Rose looked at the angular figure opposite, and
the color came again slowly to her cheeks and the
light to her eyes. “I’m so glad you came, Cousin
Emily!” she exclaimed; “without you I should
have just given up, they looked so—so indifferent,
those men with their eye-glasses and their notebooks
and their stare.”</p>

<p>“Stare? I should think so!” replied Miss
Carter severely; “I’ll put a Frenchman against
anything for staring. I believe myself that Paris
is a Sodom and Gomorrah boiled into one, let me
tell you! How any nice sweet girl can marry one
of them— Rose, if anything should ever induce
me at any time to think of marrying one, clap me
into an insane asylum, you hear?”</p>

<p>And Rose, burying her face in her hands,
laughed until she cried.</p>

<p>But without Miss Carter and Aunt Hannah her
courage would have failed her often in the months
which followed. She was put back at the alphabet
of music and worked with the beginners.
More than one night she secretly cried herself to
sleep without daring to tell Cousin Emily of her
weakness. Homesickness, too, pinched her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
took the color from her cheeks, but she worked
bravely on. She had reached Paris in June and
she had failed at her trial in September. The
months which followed were crowded to the brim,
and she tried to shut her heart and her ears to
news from home, except that which concerned her
father. The judge’s letters were purposely cheerful
and optimistic, he said so little about financial
difficulties that it seemed like a troubled dream to
Rose; she never quite realized all it meant to her
future.</p>

<p>At last, after many months, her instructor told
her one morning that he should bring some competent
judges to hear her again and, if she succeeded
at this second test, he should try to give
her a great opportunity to win her place in the
world as a singer. Rose’s heart thrilled. The
great man said little, but at last she perceived that
he believed in her in spite of her failure, that
her voice had finally won his confidence. A word
from him was more than a volume from another;
it meant success or failure. The girl, full of her
dreams of singing and redeeming all with her
voice, trembled all over and turned pale. There
was a great excitement at the little <i>pension</i> that
night; confident though she was, Miss Carter secretly
wiped away a tear, and they both worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
late to give some fresh touches to the girl’s white
gown which brought it up to date; it was a
year old, and not made in Paris! They began
to see such differences, to recognize the enchanting
creations in the show-windows and out walking
on the fashionable women on the boulevards.</p>

<p>However, Cousin Emily had her opinion about
its owner’s appearance in that same old white
frock, and she stole out and bought a single rose
for the young singer to wear the next afternoon.
Aunt Hannah helped dress her; it was a great
occasion; the little flat looked as though a whirlwind
had struck it, and at last the two went out in
great trepidation to keep the appointment. Secretly
Miss Emily longed to give those Frenchmen
a piece of her mind about criticizing the voice of
a sweet young girl, but she only retired discreetly
to a corner and looked on with a peculiar moisture
on her spectacles which required the constant
use of her handkerchief.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As Rose ceased singing and the last clear notes
of her voice floated into the distances of the great
empty concert-hall, the thrill of its sweetness, its
purity, its young confident power, seemed to fill
the very atmosphere of the place with exquisite
music; it could not quite pass away into silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
it remained at last, if not in the ears, in the souls
of the listeners, a little group to the right of the
stage who had gathered there to hear the wonderful
pupil, his youthful prima donna, the great
gift which, he believed, the new world had for the
old.</p>

<p>In the midst of her song she had forgotten herself,
her audience, her first failure, even the world
itself, while her young ardent soul poured out
its joy and its grief in those splendid notes.
Love, that great interpreter of the heart, had unlocked
hers to sorrow, she sang with the heart
of the sorrowful; she was, first of all, as Allestree
felt, an impersonation of youth, and she sang
with the soul of youth which hopes forever; she
loved, purely, unselfishly, gently, and she sang
with the love of the world on her lips, and singing
thus was supremely lovely; what matter if the old
white dress was a little out of fashion? She was
a figure as symbolic of youth with its splendid
hopes, its faith, its untried strength, as she was
the very personification of beautiful womanhood.</p>

<p>No one spoke, no one applauded, but not an
eye was dry.</p>

<p>But to Rose, whose ears were not filled with
her own music, the silence which followed it came
with a shock of terrible revulsion. She waited a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
moment in keen suspense, but no one spoke, no
one moved; the wave of silence that followed the
wave of sound engulfed her hopes, she remembered
that first disappointment. Bitter dismay
swept over her, she turned away to hide her emotion,
but the maestro crossed the stage at that
instant and held out his hand; he could not praise
her but there was actually a tear in his eye.</p>

<p>Rose looked up, and reading his face burst
into tears of joy, her hopes suddenly fulfilled.</p>

<p>Then the party of judges broke out with a
round of applause and one little Frenchman, with
a polished pink bald head and mustaches, shouted:
“Brava!”</p>

<p>In the end they crowded around her and overwhelmed
her with compliments; they were eager
to invite her to a supper and drink her health
in champagne, but the staid Virginia cousin,
in the old-fashioned black bonnet and the old black
alpaca gown, which outraged Paris without hiding
the good heart beneath it, frowned on this
hilarity; her deep-seated suspicion of the Parisian
in general had not been dissipated by this burst
of applause. She insisted that Rose, who was
trembling with excitement and the strain of the
long hours of training, should go straight back
to their little apartment to rest. A decision too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
full of wisdom for even Rose, eager though she
was for the sweet meed of praise, to resist it.</p>

<p>They drove back in a fiacre, a wild extravagance
which they ventured in view of the great success
and the immediate prospects of a fortune; the
cousin felt that they were immediate.</p>

<p>“You all were always talented,” she said to
Rose, as they drove down the rue de Rivoli;
“your mother could do anything; we always
said so. Cousin Sally Carter, too, is going to be
an artist, and no one ever made preserves like
Cousin Anna’s! I reckon it’s in the family,
Rose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Emily!” Rose sighed, and hid her
face on the alpaca shoulder, “oh, if I can only,
only sing so well that there shall be no more
terrible trouble for father!”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you worry about the judge,
child,” Cousin Emily replied soothingly; “it will
all come out right and, anyway, the best families
haven’t money now-a-days!” she added with ineffable
disdain, “it’s very vulgar.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d risk having it, though!” Rose
said, with a sigh.</p>

<p>She was really in a dream. The softness of
spring was in the atmosphere as they drove
through the gay streets, and all the trees in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
garden of the Tuileries were delicately fringed
with green; the voices of children, the sounds of
laughter, now and then a snatch of song, reminded
them that it was a holiday. Rose thought of
home; the Persian lilac must be budding, the tulip
trees, of course, were in flower; a pang of homesickness
seized her, a longing to see the old house
again—ah, there was the sorrow of it, could they
keep the old house much longer? With these
thoughts came others, deeply perturbed, which
she tried to thrust away. She knew of Margaret’s
sudden death, but she had heard but little of it,
of Fox nothing. Her father’s letters excluded
the whole matter; Mrs. Allestree’s were chary in
mention of it, and from Robert there was no word
on the subject. Gerty English, strangely enough,
had not written since Margaret’s death, and Rose
could only piece together the dim outlines of a
tragedy which touched her to the soul. There
had been moments when she had been bitter against
poor Margaret, had held her responsible, now
she thought of her with pity.</p>

<p>As these things floated before her, in a confused
dream of sorrow and regret, she was scarcely
conscious of Cousin Emily’s chatter, or of the
streets through which they passed, but presently
they were set down at their own door and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
paid the cabman; Cousin Emily’s French was excellent
but it belonged exclusively to the classroom
and the phrase-book, and no one in Paris
understood it, a fact which bewildered her more
than any of her other experiences.</p>

<p>They found the <i>pension</i> disturbed by a fire in
an adjoining house, and Aunt Hannah was sitting
on top of Rose’s trunk with her bonnet on, waiting
to be assured that the flames could not reach
her.</p>

<p>“It’s all out, Aunt Hannah,” Rose assured her,
laughing; “the concierge says it was out half
an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“He don’ know nuthin’ about it, Miss Rose; he
ain’t sure dat he’s a liar, an’ I knows he is, bekase
I’se caught him at it,” the old woman replied
firmly; “de place might be afire sure nuff. It
was one ob dem ’lection wires dat set de odder
house off, an’ dis place is full ob dem; I don’
tole him ter cut ’em loose, an’ he keep on jabberin’
like a monkey; I ain’t got no manner ob
use fo’ dese French people no-ways!”</p>

<p>“Nor has Cousin Emily!” laughed Rose, taking
off her hat and tossing it to Aunt Hannah,
while she passed her hand over her bright hair
with a light, deft touch which seemed to bring
every ripple into a lovelier disorder; “the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
concierge is a good soul, and he does make us
comfortable here.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe he is, an’ mebbe he ain’t!” said Aunt
Hannah grudgingly; “dese men folks allus waits
on a pretty girl, honey, but I ’lows he’d cheat
yo’ jest de same; I’se got my eye on him sure!”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d take off your bonnet and get my
trunk open,” retorted Rose good naturedly; “then
we’ll see if we can put the concierge in it—if
he misbehaves!”</p>

<p>“My sakes, honey, I done clean forgot ter gib
yo’ dis letter; it’s a telegram, I reckon; it come
jest befo’ de fire broke out, an’ I’se been settin’ on
it ter keep it safe.”</p>

<p>It was a cablegram, and Rose stretched out an
eager hand for it, with a thrill of anticipation; it
seemed as if her father must be reaching out to
her across the seas, that he already knew and rejoiced
with her for, surely, all his prejudices would
dissolve at the assurance of her success.</p>

<p>She opened it with trembling fingers, a smile
on her lips. It fluttered and fell to the floor; it
was a cablegram to summon her home, the judge
was very ill.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">IX</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTERWARDS Rose never quite knew how
she endured the voyage home. Her love
for her father was so deep, so tender, they
were so bound together by a hundred ties not only
of affection but of sympathy and tastes and interests,
that the very thought of losing him almost
broke her down. It took both Cousin Emily Carter
and old black Aunt Hannah to comfort and sustain
her during those ten days.</p>

<p>But when she reached Washington Allestree met
her at the station with good tidings; the judge
was out of danger. He had been very near death
and came back slowly from the Valley of the
Shadow. However, he had come back and Rose
knelt beside his bed and cried her heart out with
joy to feel his arm around her. How pale and thin
and wasted he looked. He had aged so much;
poor Rose, she saw it and forced a smile to disguise
it even to herself. But he was unaware of
the shock which the sight of him gave her, and he
forgot his illness in his eager interest in her account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
of Paris and her final success. She told him
very little of those long months of struggle and
depression, of the thousand little pinches and trials
that they had been through to keep from asking
an extra penny from him.</p>

<p>After Rose came the judge began to mend more
rapidly; old Mrs. Allestree said he had only been
pining away for the child, but she knew better, being
a wise old woman. She knew that the judge
had been struggling all the year to stave off the
foreclosure of the mortgage on the old house which
he and Rose loved so well. She knew, too, that he
had almost failed when that mysterious arrangement
was made for him by an unknown party; the
message came that the mortgage had been taken
up, and he could have all the time he wanted and
at a lower rate of interest.</p>

<p>This news, so amazing and so unprecedented,
had been synchronous with the judge’s breakdown
and had, Mrs. Allestree believed, contributed to it.
The sudden relief had snapped the strain on his
nerves, and he slipped down into a state of coma.
However, she did not tell Rose this, nor her suspicions,
which were fast becoming certainties,
about the mortgage; she only kissed her affectionately
and made her sing to her the song which had
won such an ovation from the French critics, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
which Cousin Emily Carter had described with enthusiasm
before she departed to the Tidewater
region, where she hoped to cut her own asparagus
bed and set out her flowers undisturbed by Parisian
manners and customs.</p>

<p>Allestree welcomed Rose with even greater relief
than his mother and the judge, but wisdom had
taught him to rejoice in silence, and he did so,
being careful, however, to send promptly for her
portrait which, according to the agreement between
Mrs. Allestree and the judge, could not be
loaned during Rose’s presence in the house, but
only as a consolation in her absence. But the
judge sighed deeply when they told him it had
been returned to the studio again.</p>

<p>It was during the first days of her father’s convalescence
that Rose found Margaret’s letter to
her among his papers; not knowing Rose’s address
in Paris, Margaret had sent it in the judge’s care
and he had overlooked it when he forwarded the
letters, as he did, once a week. By a strange accident
it had slipped under some pamphlets in the
basket on his library table and lay there until Rose,
rearranging his papers one morning, came upon
it and recognizing the writing broke the seal with
some trepidation, for Margaret had never been an
intimate correspondent, and Rose divined some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
serious reason for this long closely written letter.
She was alone when she found it, and she went to
the open window and stood there reading it.</p>

<p>Margaret, moved by the deep sorrow and passion
which had swept over her poor troubled soul
in those last days of her life, had poured out her
heart. She told Rose all; that she had come between
her and Fox; in her wild and covetous jealousy
she had thought to wrest happiness from
despair; to keep his love she had been willing to
lose all, and she had lost! She concealed nothing,
the last pitiful words of the letter, a remarkable
letter of passion and grief and self-sacrifice, told
Rose that she was going to give up her life to her
children and try to live down her desertion of
them.</p>

<p>Rose read it through to the end, and then covered
her face with her hands, trying to shut out
the terrifying picture that it had unconsciously
drawn of a woman, desolate, shipwrecked, without
hope in earth or heaven. The terrors which had
possessed Margaret’s soul swept over hers. All
that Mrs. Allestree had told her, and that Gerty,
poor, voluble, good-hearted Gerty, had enlarged
upon, filled out the scene. The lonely walk, the
visit to the studio, the unfriended and miserable
death; she did not know of those other scenes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
the church and the curiosity-shop where Margaret
had found her heart, but she did know of a strange
girl who had brought a single white lily to lay in
Margaret’s dead hand and gone away weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>She had blamed poor Margaret, judged her;
Rose felt it at that moment and accused herself
of heartlessness; of Fox she dared not think. In
the new light which this letter shed on the situation,
she began to understand how cruelly he had
been placed, and there, too, she had judged!</p>

<p>Poor Rose,—her father had inculcated stern
and simple lessons and she had tried, before all
things, to be just; but to be judicious and calm
and in love at the same time was an impossible
combination. She dashed the tears from her eyes,
and thrust Margaret’s letter into her pocket and
went about her duties with the air of a soldier on
guard, but her lip would quiver at intervals and
she could not sing a note when the judge asked
for one of the old ballads that he had loved as a
boy, and Rose had learned, to please him.</p>

<p>It was about this time that she began to wonder
if the old house must go, or if her father had been
able to meet all the payments due upon it. She
dared not ask him, and he said nothing, but she noticed
that now that he was able to be moved into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
library every day and sometimes into the garden
in the warm spring sunshine, that he sat for hours
at a time in a brown study with a deep furrow between
his brows, and constantly pushing back his
hair from his forehead, as he did in moments of
perplexity. She was afraid to speak, lest any mention
of the trouble which had so beset him would
bring back the fever and a relapse, so she had to
content herself with hope and waited for some sign
on his part.</p>

<p>The old house had never seemed so dear; the
mantling vines were full out in new foliage, birds
were nested on the southern wall toward the garden,
and the old garden-plot itself, so sheltered
and secluded by the house and the high brick wall
which shut out the street, was just coming into
bloom. The roses she had set out the spring before
were in bud, and the peonies were blooming. Rose
looked about her with a sigh and forgot that she
would, perhaps, be one day a great prima donna
with the world at her feet. Such things do not
always fill a woman’s heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the judge had written and despatched
a letter with great secrecy, and one morning, after
he was wheeled into his library, he told Rose that
she might take her sewing into the garden for he
expected a gentleman on business and he might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
there half an hour. She obeyed him with a stifling
sensation of anxiety; she knew it was that mortgage,
that terrible mortgage, and his reticence
convinced her that he was concealing bad news
from her. She took her sewing out to the little
arbor in the corner, where the library windows were
out of sight, and she tried to sew, but her fingers
trembled so that she lost her needle and, having
neglected to provide herself with another, she sat
and watched the robin on the lawn and wished
money grew up like grass out of the well tilled
earth and was of as little consequence. Yet, all
the while, it was not of herself she thought but of
her father, broken in health, old and careworn,
facing those inexorable obligations without even
her help.</p>

<p>The judge alone in the library watched the
clock with an anxious eye, and thought of Rose
and all it would mean to her if he could save the
property. When he lay near death the one overwhelming
horror of his heart had been to leave her
at the mercy of the world. The old man glanced
about him with the same fond recognition of
familiar objects; it is strange how dear these inanimate
things, which were here before we came
and will be here when we are gone, become so valuable
to us. To the judge they had associations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
The picture over the mantel had been bought by
his grandfather, those books dated still farther
back in the family; the clock had belonged to his
mother’s great grandfather, the old secretary of
polished mahogany, with secret drawers and brass
mountings, was an heirloom,—it had held a will
which had nearly disrupted the family two generations
back. Small matters, but to an old man inexpressibly
interesting and sacred. Of the house
he did not like to think; that was full of memories
of his wife, and he could not now explain the madness
which had led him to mortgage it to pay off
more pressing claims which had followed his first
heavy losses.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">X</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ROSE had been ten minutes in the garden,
and the judge was beginning to fidget in
his chair when he heard the front door open
and shut and at last steps came toward the library.
A moment later William Fox entered the room.
As he came into the mellow light from the open
window the judge was struck by the change in
his strong pale face. The old smile which had come
so easily to his lips, and which, at times, had almost
the sweetness of a woman’s, was gone; the
brow and chin had a new resolution. The man
was changed. Judge Temple saw it and held out
his hand with a sudden impulse of warmer sympathy
than he had felt before. After all, Fox had
met it like a man and paid the cost.</p>

<p>On his side, Fox was as strongly affected by the
broken appearance of the old man in his invalid
chair with his white head and his sunken eyes.
“My dear judge,” he said, “I hope you’re feeling
better? I was glad to obey your summons, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
I’m not sure that I understand the reference in
your note.”</p>

<p>The judge looked at him a moment in silence,
then drawing a letter from his pocket, opened it
and handed it to him. Fox took it with evident
reluctance; as he read it he colored a little and
folding it hastily, handed it back without a word.</p>

<p>“I did not know until yesterday, sir, to whom
I was indebted,” Judge Temple said slowly, his lip
trembling slightly from weakness and profound
emotion.</p>

<p>Fox stirred uneasily in his chair, his color deepening.
“I didn’t intend you to know it at all,
judge,” he said, almost with an air of diffidence;
“I presume I owe my betrayal to Berkman. However,
I want to assure you—since it is known—that
you can have all the time you desire; I consider
it a good investment!”</p>

<p>The judge’s spectacles grew misty and he took
them off hurriedly and wiped them, his thin hands
shaking as he did it. “I thank you for your confidence,”
he said quietly, when he could speak;
“you’ll get it—every cent.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I tell you I consider it a good investment,
the best I ever made,” Fox retorted smiling;
“I’m not usually so judicious in my ventures.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>The old man tried to force an answering smile
but he failed, his head sank on his breast and his
hands, lying on the carved arms of his great
chair, still trembled. Fox looked at him in some
anxiety, half afraid that the excitement and relief
had been too much, and bitterly indignant that
his secret had been betrayed. It had been a difficult
matter for him to take up the mortgage, for
he was by no means a rich man, but he had vowed
in his heart to save Rose her home, the home that
he knew she loved so well, and half the joy of doing
it had been to do it without her knowledge; but it
seemed impossible to keep a secret which, from its
very nature, must be shared with others.</p>

<p>The change in the old face opposite was alarmingly
sharp.</p>

<p>“My dear judge, you are too indisposed for
business; let me ring for assistance,” Fox exclaimed,
with real concern.</p>

<p>But the judge protested. “Sir, I’m better to-day
than I have been for a year,” he said, a slight
break in his voice; “I see my way clear, I’ll be
able to save this property, I—” he broke off and
passed his handkerchief over his eyes; there was
a moment’s painful silence, then he held out his
hand. “God bless you, Fox!” he broke out suddenly,
“it was killing me to lose it—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>They shook hands. Fox had risen and his face
was colorless. “Don’t tell her, judge,” he said
abruptly.</p>

<p>The old man started and was about to speak
but, meeting the other’s eye, refrained. Many
things came into his mind, among them a memory
of Rose’s face at Mrs. O’Neal’s ball. It was a bitter
moment; no man was good enough for her,
and this man had been too much talked about! Yet
the child’s happiness was near his heart.</p>

<p>With a certain reluctance Fox turned at last to
go, and as he did so his glance passed through the
open window into the garden. “I can reach the
gate by this path, can I not?” he asked, moving
toward it.</p>

<p>The judge started uneasily, with an involuntary
gesture as if to detain him, to keep him back at
any cost, but Fox did not see it and the old man
sank back in his chair quiescent. His lips moved
but he said nothing; after all, had he a right to
interfere? Unconsciously the younger man went
out of the window and down the two short steps
to the gravel path.</p>

<p>The judge watched him disappear behind the
Persian lilac with a fascinated eye. Then he took
out his handkerchief again, and passing it swiftly
across his brow pushed back his scant white hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
until it seemed to rise up in active protest. The
glare of the May sunshine suddenly hurt his gaze
and he shook out his handkerchief and threw it
over his head, closing his eyes.</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah, opening the door a moment later,
with a pleasant jingle of ice in the mint-julep
glass on her tray, peeped in, thought him asleep
and cautiously and discreetly closed the door
again. “Fo’ de Lord,” she murmured, “ef it
ain’t de fust time dat he didn’t kinder sense dat
de julep was comin’; I reckon he’s right po’ly!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Fox turned the corner by the lilac, walking
slowly, holding his hat behind his back, his bare
head bowed. His face was gloomy with thought,
and he almost passed the arbor. At the turn a
glint of white caught his eye and he looked up
quickly and saw Rose industriously sewing without
a needle, her head down over her work and the
sunshine filtering through a trellis of vines on her
soft bright hair and her white gown.</p>

<p>He came toward her with an exclamation of unrestrained
joy, but as their eyes met a wave of
mutual feeling swept over their souls and left them
mute. Between them seemed to lie the sorrow and
the love of that beautiful and unfortunate woman
who had separated them. The language of conventionality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
was no longer possible; Rose tried to
speak, but her words died in an inarticulate murmur.
The anguish of Margaret’s letter came back
to her; it had saved Fox in her eyes; she no longer
condemned him, she no longer felt it a duty to
avoid him, but she found it impossible to tell him
of the change in her heart by any commonplace
word of friendship. Her hand had slipped from
his eager grasp and lay trembling on her work.
It was terrible to betray herself so; her cheek
reddened and tears of mortification came into her
eyes. But to speak to him of common things at
such a moment—how could she? And he made no
effort to help her, but only watched her, his soul
in his eyes. The marks of suffering on his face
touched her, too; the lines had sharpened, the gaze
deepened and become more introspective, the shock
of primitive passions had really decentralized his
life. He smiled at the sight of her, almost the old
eager smile, but even that light had died out of
his face now, and in the pause she seemed to hear
her own heart beating against her breast.</p>

<p>He stood looking at her. “How long must I
be silent?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>Rose busied herself in a fruitless attempt to
thread an imaginary needle, and her slender fingers
shook. It had been in her mind to tell him that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Margaret had written her, but as he spoke a
sudden intuition of the truth arrested her impulse,
a flood of light poured in upon her, illuminating
the twilight of her thought. She felt that he must
not only never know of Margaret’s confession—she
had not meant to tell him that—but not even
of her letter. It was impossible to answer him;
her lips were tremulous as she looked up and met
his grave, compelling gaze. In her look, so full
of buoyant and beautiful youth, there was not even
the shadow of reproach. Her simplicity, her renewal
of confidence in him, were profoundly touching;
the bitterness and humiliation of the past
months seemed at last sanctified by her forbearance.
The secret agony which had torn his heart during
the long winter fell away from the present; it belonged
at once to the past, sinking into that long
vista which leads to oblivion. To-day was beautiful
and strong with hope.</p>

<p>Before her youth and purity William Fox experienced
a feeling of sudden and complete humility.
“Can you forgive me?” he asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Margaret’s letter seemed to breathe its message
in her ears. “There’s nothing to forgive,” Rose
said simply.</p>

<p>“You understand?” there was passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
eagerness in his glance; his love for her was sweeping
away the obstacles from his mind, leaping up
again to demand its right to exist.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rose said, with white lips, “I understand,
not fully—but—”</p>

<p>“And now?” he was strongly moved; not
knowing whose hand had lifted the veil of her misunderstanding
and far from divining the truth.</p>

<p>“And now?” the tears gathered in her eyes
and fell unheeded; “I cannot but think of her
love—her unhappiness!”</p>

<p>“And you still blame me?” Fox stood motionless,
his face resuming its stern reserve.</p>

<p>Rose shook her head. “I—I cannot!” she
murmured, remembering that confession, and the
thought of it sealing her lips.</p>

<p>He started, the color rushing to his temples, the
kindling passion of his glance transforming him.
“Rose!”</p>

<p>She looked up through her tears, and as suddenly
hid her face in her hands. “I am afraid!”
she murmured brokenly, “out of—of all this sorrow
can there be happiness?”</p>

<p>Fox sat down beside her and gently took her
hand. “You mean you cannot trust me?” he
asked soberly.</p>

<p>For a moment she did not answer. He looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
down at her drooping profile, the lovely arch of
her brow, the soft cheek and chin; her eyes no
longer met his. “Or is it that you do not love
me?” he said quietly.</p>

<p>She raised her head at that, and the dawning
sweetness of her glance illumined his soul. “It is
because I love you—that I can no longer judge!”
she faltered, with trembling lips.</p>

<p>He met her look without a word; language,
for the moment, had not significance for them.</p>

<p>Silence, filled with the sweet murmur of summer
life, the fragrance of flowers, the audible rustling
of the magnolia leaves, seemed to enfold them in a
new and beautiful world.</p>
